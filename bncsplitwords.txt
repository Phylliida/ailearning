Mm well the thing is there's some similar conversation going on in
are there
but er I don't think they've got as far as yours have
Nooh I mean personally I think it would be better for the United Reformed to join up with the shared pastures instead of joining up with the Methodist because the Methodist have got plenty of church es in their are a haven't they
They have there yes and
Yes
and the trouble is of course they've the Methodist haven't really joined up themselves

Was born in Brock ly
Aha
I wasn't born
sorry about that
That's alright
my father well he does speak Welsh and my mother could understand it
I see
but she couldn't speak it
Mm
and I'd always been sorry that my dad told us you know
I've been trying to learn it but I haven't got very far
No I don't think I I'm too old now
I'm almost sorry that
Well I was er seventy six when I started learning it
Yeah me nephew he lives up by er m Clan Der r is
Ah yes
Mm
and by he and his wife were headmaster in the village village of and their master headmaster used to give Wallace two lessons and they had it in different houses you know
I see yes
because they get very naughty up there
and they're living there and they don't speak Welsh
Mm
you know they when they first went up there to live they er had quite a problem and the trouble was was the two boys they were born in Australia you see and they came here and one was four and the other
yes
of course they had a problem hadn't they
English speaking in the house and Welsh at school
so it was quite and er then they they well they weren't learning very well at all
Oh
they always seemed backward they found that they took them to different specialist and the truth is they've both left school now and got jobs but they were er dyslexia
Oh goodness
they found out both of them
Oh
but they got jobs quite good jobs and the fella who it is employing them he's one himself so he employs that sort of people you see
Mm
But they get on now
Good
but they they passed the driving test first time and you know er they couldn't find out what it
Mm sorry i the was only partly the language then
Pardon
He was only partly the language then
Yes yeah
Mm
yeahthat's very you know it'll it quite embarrassed in school and that and er m for them
Mm
but er as I say they've grown now and got these jobs and they're quite happy
Good
But surprising the people that you don't realise you know it troubles the parents and as I say they took them to a number of specialists and given different things
Mm
couldn't find out
Mm
why and then of course this all came out
alright
alright goodbye then
Do you want your paper
Oh it's not very valuable is it
Thanks
Thank you goodbye
I don't think I I'm likely to say anything use use down and taken in evidence against me
It's all supposed to be anonymous anyway
Right now do you like er
Yes oh yes yes
Right
It doesn't it doesn't really matter right
Right hope that'll be alright
Yeah that's a nice er slot were you looking to go out in the garden
Yes era yes
Er help yourself
Have a take as much as you like there's another packet there
Oh right that'll do me I think thank you
I didn't want to put the new stuff on top of the old until er knew whether we'd finished or not yes I think I'll have to open it
Getting into those things is er a major task inn it
Yes
These plastic bags and various
That's a nice big greenhouse you've got there
Yes er we put that on as a we bought it as a do it yourself job
Oh yeah aha
how long ago I mean how long has it been there
Er m nearly twelve years I think now no must must be more than that
ah have to get a pair of scissors
What brought you to this part when you went back to
Well largely because we couldn't afford a house in the are a where we both grew up
Where was that
The south east London
Oh yeah oh right
At least I was born in Kent but er brought up in south east London
Oh yeah where the whereabouts
Er m born in Well ing and er and thenthen we moved to Lewis ham
Mmmm
er m that was immediately after the war you know the first war
Right did your er m wife come from the same are a
Well in a way although her parents were Scotch
Oh
her mother's family from S t Andrews and her father from Dun dee
Oh but they moved out of London long before
Er m oh he came to London to get work
Yeah
Yeah
And what made you choose this particular part of
Well one one of my sons is married to er gi r girl whose family live in Buckley
Ohoh
and er originally when when we first sought to retiring retiring we were attracted to the Da les but we couldn't afford that
No no this is the great problem of er at the moment oh it was C W M when you retired wasn't it
Mm
And er m and did they had they got their nanny form of assistance
They had but it was er m much less satisfactory as a U R C one
Mm
but they've changed now they're more or less on the same basis as the U R C
Oh
but er m it didn't look a very attractive proposition at the time
Oh
for one thing if we'd taken one of their houses and I'd died first my wife would of been left without a home
Oh dear
except for going to the er you know they've got that place in Worth ing er m
Yeah
er m
Yeah
Levers House
Yeah
but we were neither of us very keen on that
No not really no Could you of chosen er m where to have the house or did they have some that had been left for that purpose
Er m I'm not really sure we didn't go into it very deeply
No
Fortunately Ruth had some money from her father which covered buying this house
Ohoh
er m At that time property was fairly cheap in Bradley
Mmmm
we got this for seven and a half thousand
Oh b limey mm
I think it cost more than that now
Oh I think so yeah you wouldn't purchase the land that it stands on for that now
Mind you it's only a paper profit because you can't rely on it
No no Where are you from originally ah
London east London East Ham actually I was brought up till I was about seven er in the same are a but er m in a place called Beck ton
Oh that's where the gas works used to be
That's right yeah just over not far over the water from er the Wool w ich
That's right no yes I know not far from where we live really
Mmmm and I often tell people that er those who don't come from London don't realise the difference between north and south
Mm
south London they're two different worlds aren't they
In a way
Yes
for the people who live there they are anyway the river's a great divide
Oh yeah Yesit's amazing how a big delight it is despite all the bridges
Oh that's right mm You didn't go straight from college overseas
Well as near as possible because er mI mean I was appointed to to Africa while I was still in college
Oh mmmm
but then there was delay because of war conditions
Mmmm
so so it was nearly a year before we actually got away

Oh waiting for others yeah
but er they did stop not for longer m there's a a
er when they sit ed these boats they got out their cargo derrick s
Mm
and er let let downer m a hook each end of each boat

Did I sugar it
I don't think you did
Was there at your next tour of service shorter
Yes
after that first one
the next one was six
Oh
then it gradually reduced to two right at the end we were getting
every two years
Yes that's right yeah
but that didn't happen very often to us because it was just being introduced
That's right yeah yeah Yes our first tour was five it was supposed to be four but we er me r for some reason or other we didn't really want to come home ha four so we stretched to three
well we had one more tour after tha term but the and would really of referred to of stayed made the next tour longer than two
Mm
but er rules are rules aren't they
It seems I oh I seemed to feel that it it was if we wanted to see three it was gonna upset well they seemed that I thought it would save money if they
Mm
but we stayed home then yeah I'm not quite sure where you did go
Z amb i a
Ah
I had been into Z amb i a but not very often
Oh
In fact when I was stationed in Mule I used to travel through Z amb i a to get to one of my out stations
Oh did you
simply because the roads were better that side when it was Northern Rhodes i a
You crossed on the pon to on did you
Yes
And then came back over the bridge
O over the falls bridge
Oh we did that a few times when the the borders were closed with
came across pon to on through of course it's a much more e elaborate pon to on now then it was then
I'm sure
that was er
oh it wasn't very elaborate
well you could get one one and a half ton truck on it and it was driven across with a couple of
engines
I can't remember of it
the others with a the engine mid way
I know they did put in er a a much better ferry they
Oh yeah yeah
and then of course the Americans paid for that road up to
mm that's right yeah
but er which really was a waste of money it was well it's used a bit for tourism now
Mmmm
but it's but commercially it was of no importance
No
but it was er part of the sanction s policy against Rhodes i a
Yeah that's right
Where were you in in Z amb i a
Er mI was we was all the time we were there in er
Ah
the theological college
Mm
er the only time I really went any distance was er well I went with er Paul to
Oh yeah
it was er at a time when this an African district committee sent representatives to the central and visa ver sa
Ohoh
Mm
That must of been some time ago
Yes
Nineteen fifty something I think
er m of course the economic out in Z amb i a the economic situations is dis astro us now
and the drought of course has made it worse
Pardon
The drought
The drought yeah yeah just now the drought seems to be much more wide spread now doesn't it and er into South Africa
Well I was looking at the er
Very bad
er m
and they were saying that er South Africa 's going to have to import food this year
That's right yeah
normally South Africa feeds these other countries north further south in in bad years
Mmmm
Yes South Africa has er mere r we have a regular er m A four sheet twotwo sides of A four she e term it was weekly but it's er m a fort nightly
Mm
news letter
now it's just a news sheet from of Z amb i a
Mm
er it's pretty youthful this country with it's
Z amb i an er call it Z amb i an news pa newspapers so it's very liable as to what you know it's no comm it's not comment at all it's just and er m the last one two weeks ago I think it was indicated that er m South Africa 's production of maize would be oh I can't remember but a lot short of what they require themselves
Yeah oh it's down to about a quarter of normal it is
A quarter is it
As low as that
Because there are worries that it's going to er effect the outcome of this mad re f referendum you know they the farmers are sort of desperate and they think they need government help and they think they wouldn't get it because of the black government so
But er mB ot swana 's er m doing quite well
Oh yes well you see they've got the names
Yes that's right but er m unfortunately Z amb i a's the copper has had the copper and
Mm
the copper
er m and of course er normal years they also earn quite a lot from export ing their cat
If any of you want a copy of the document on Al der s referred to in the E cu men ical report I have some here you can study it over lunch
Before we go on to keep the to to look at the minutes and for the young people who were actually on the weekend in
Sharing everything on a different
And what I've asked is that they actually did and not separate it
The suggestion had been that in the gall er i es
So as they come in would you make a statement and then two minutes they had and that one's just next year
It makes a lot of difference cos if you've been in a church hall before
Although you don't
Just this table
Perhaps that's why we haven't got a group for the next one
Quite warm again
Yeah
They're doing it by the
Oh
What we booked the church
Do you want to see him
We got books here that the trouble
Oh yes
Things like bibles

Stand up
I can't remember your su rna me I've gotta be honest
You really wanna know
Sorry
right
Very Dutch
Mr Bob is the Minister of in the United States of America

The obviously
We welcome you

The minutes of the last thing on the and everybody should see who elected president although some people will have forgotten but I haven't
And before any I ask you whether there are two additions to these minutes
Right the first addition is on the last page under the er m the Royal Hall of Ministers and Elders to er remember their
Er m printed in the official copy for this but left off this copy were the names also the Reverend of Gl an got h w y n and the Reverend Victor of Ham well Er m does anybody else wish to make any comments on the minutes of
Knowing Martin what John has just told me about him if I didn't know him I don't think it would me anything
Brief details like that are meaningless
I trust the Ministerial Committee to make decisions and bring recommendations
On the other hand I would like to meet the candidates to see what they look like
But that doesn't a pa but what they look like is not going to affect whether I support the Ministerial Committee or not
What actual details do we give to you
Despite what David said that
Yeah
rather hurt
Putting it in therefore we did read the description
Yes oh oh
Actually I think David is right
I it didn't come over but for me when we interviewed Martin is one of most refreshing interviews I've had the pleasure of taking part in
He's a man of rare who was so privileged to go to Cambridge and to be interviewed
And came back having learnt a new verse
which was probably written about twenty or thirty years ago but recognised that his own congregation s would be very suspicious of them
And it de lights from this thank you John
Okay number two would you please af firm the call of I an for in the psychiatric unit
No
Would you of
our counselling
I've been involved in interview with
Don't you like my
Right
Yes he's about five foot eleven
er m he is a member of Van roch Ca er philly at U RC and has done I think he is currently at and er m have felt a gentle call emerging over the last few years and er m all started in Cambridge that's about it that's all I can say
Oxford
Oxford sorry
Had too much
All in favour of er Ian's call being af firm ed please
Thank you
And third ly we ask you to af firm the call of Peter for praying for in the ministry
Peter is a member of right he's actually a member of C ly g art hy U RC but he works and has er m as a form of day pastor and
Member of Clan o the l U RC and has worked and served as a form of day pastor at C ly g art hy U RC and he has come from the An gl i can tradition Church of England and he has er m over the years towards the reform tradition
He seeks to work as a ministry within the Vale and brings tremendous in er m to the ministry which he he will hopefully let the side
He is also a self - e m p l o y e d
I thought he'd be t outing for business
We are not at the time of business we are here to af firm the call
All in favour please show
Thank you

So they started their ministry off together and I think it's something quite special to me and to recognise that we have sent three people off on a journey and three people two here have come to the end of a journey and just part of the journey and are beginning to discover that will be discovered in the life of the three human beings human beings
at the time
Shall we remember and these three friends in life
Lord we thank you for the ways in which you challenge and call people to all forms of ministry within the light of your church
And especially we thank you today for the call of Martin and I an and Richard to the Ministry of Word and Sac ram ent within the light of your church
We pray for them and their families
We pray for them in their studies
In their pilgrimage to discover more of your presence in their lives
As they begin a particular stage of the ministry we also pray for those who are coming towards the end of that particular stage of the ministry
Remember especially Bob and Roy and we pray that you will enable them to find fu l film ent and enjoyment and enrich ment in their lives as they step forward in faith and confidence in Lord in your mercy
Amen
Amen
Reports are not always about revolution s and that's important
And you will see that we now have a good er m
Well over to Noel to relax with each other thoughts questions comments about the life of the ministry of the church
And happens some people have prepared particular presentation s you will see after one is on and one of political insubordination one on the process of learning together
Five districts have er m prepared some of vision in order to share that vision or that example of what is happening in the districts relating to the ministry er m with the and those who have come to us as well
And one church has prepared a little presentation or mind - s t r e t c h i n g h e a r t - s t r e t c h i n g thought of church and community
So we'rewe're here now to relax
To talk about the Ministry of Office
I think in starting this off I would like to encourage as many people to take place in conversation if possible
And I will include in that those who are younger than most of us here
Er to talk about what you think about the ministry of the church as well
We're talking about this partly because of the document passed in the ministry in which everybody has avid ly read and er m has been talked about after the seventeen th erin York in July
But I think the more important reason for talking about the Ministry of the New Church or the Ministry of the Church is because of the er m developing needs and the developing thoughts and ideas which are actually additions which are the the crucial are a where ministry takes place
First of all I think it would be useful if we were clear that with the new ministry was a waste
Too often we are limited in thinking of ministry as those who either do or do not work where are thought of
And we might call those Ministers if you like with a big M.
Er m but we'll be talking about the Ministry of the Church
We're actually talking about I mean if you remember this we're talking about the abs in it y of the body of Christ
That is the Ministry of the Church
But each one that's here however old or however young are a part an active part an essential part a crucial part of the Ministry of the Body of Christ
We are these
And how we relate within the church and how we relate outside the church although in essence there is nothing outside the church there is nothing that that position
Okay
As you look into your shaving mirror in the morning you shall say hello Minister how are you
Or as you look into your drawer in the morning to find out what you need to put into your hand bag in the day you say hello Minister how are you
Okay
That's
We're also talking in terms of a ministry which what you expect is very often what you get you're trained to be somebody okay
And one of the things that these training s help you is that if you expect something of a child then you're much more likely to get it
That way it's positive
If you expect that child is going to do a fantastic job on that painting then that encourage ment and confidence is coming across
It also works negative ly
If you don't expect much from little Tommy then little Tommy is less and less likely to give you anything much
So we're talking about ministry
We're talking about something which is bound by our expectations
We need to be aware of our expectations because our expectations can be limiting and can be stretching and inspiring
We also are exercising the Ministry of the Church within a context
We've learnt something about the church and
One of the context s in which we are exercising ministry is that we have for the last fifty years well I haven't personally
But for the last fifty years or so for most of us the experience of the church has been declined and closer and reducing number of people with dog collars
Okay
There have been negative interference
We need to be aware of how those can actually triple the numbers
We need to be aware of how we are sub consciously taught
A Ge o graph er knows that and the whole environment importance
A Ge o graph er also knows that in order to use maps you need to know where you are
You can't get anywhere without knowing where we are
Half of our exercise in listening to each other is to know where we are
In order that we can begin to recognise the movements and the visions and the views of where we can be
Knowing where we are in terms of the way in which we are tricked into having bad
Knowing where we are in the way in which we are tricked into believing that er m our church es now are weaker than when they were founded and probably most of you many of you have heard my children's prayer
the children are the difference between church es now and church es in the past
Especially at church ann i ver sar i es
And nine times out of ten when I ask the congregation whether your church is bigger now than it was when it was founded nine times out of ten the congregation say it is smaller now than when it was founded
And nine point nine times out of ten they are wrong
We've got a wrong false image of the
And that is harmful
And it's parallel
Those visions come from within ourselves
Come from the way in which we don't necessarily take on board what we are learning
They come also from orgasm ic enters or whatever such programme s there are go around these days
Carole you tell the people sitting next to you what orgasm ic is
What did he say
I don't know
Is it Derek N im mo
In the nineteen fifties
I never
Er m
I never watched it in fact
There's also the whole of notion of what we are saying by our ministry together
Okay
What we are what we are saying by our buildings
sort of ended in a little
What we are saying by our notice boards
Many of which are still in action
What we are saying by our commitment or our attitude
What we are saying by the way in which we share what we are saying by our commitment to justice and peace
All of these are involved and a part of our ministry
And that again might be me but many of you when you've heard me say it in a service I've ended up with my asking at the end of a sermon asking the congregation to smile
Now you know that's how many of you I have I done that to
Well that that may be a reflection on me okay
But what are we saying by our expressions both within worship and outside
And of course our discussion of ministry i. e. the activity of the people of God is not just a domestic thing about the U RC
I mean we we get bound up with with all sorts of domestic things and will I expect later today
But it's also er m about discovering the complete ness of the ministry of the people of God as we enter through the various commitment s that we have to our sister church es in Wales and in Britain and in the world whether it's routine or a particular relationship of members or All that's part of the context of the ways in which we're talking about and sharing with each other with God
Please smile
There is a list here three major's presentation s on communion on political insubordination and on the pilgrimage of learning together
I think what we'll do is hear each of those three presentation s and then I will allow a time for comment especially discussion after each I will limit that to make sure we get time for all so that's that's the way we're going to do it
Thank you
But first of all in terms of a precede n cy attitude I hope I'm looking in the right place
N annette er m is going to lead us in our
N annette would you like everybody where you are and who you are
N annette the Minister of the United Reform Church in Mert hy r also sharing the ministry with the Presbyterian Church of Wales in Mert hy r and Mert hy r Vale
Thank you John for that introduction
I remember John coming to Mert hy r and asking the young people to find see if there was anybody who was over a hundred in the congregation
And the dazzling thing was that quite a few made a bee line for a lady who co could at least give thirty years
I thought haven't noticed from where I'm standing
In preparing ours for today and the whole question of thinking of being main precede n cy of communion rests in our understanding er m of ord i nation which I know later we we will have time to discuss
But may I ask yo of you a question not for answers but will er m perhaps come later in the debate and that is what does the service of Holy Communion mean to you
Our answers will get crushed
But one thing that I would share with you and it's this is that whenever the friends of Jesus eat and drink together they remember him his sac r if i cia l love for them and the wonderful gift of freedom that he has made possible
I'll say at the outset that Holy Communion is not something that we play about with
Our communion service is part of the rich tradition which has been passed down to us from Jesus Christ
But having sa said that I have to share with you the a key element erin the life of the church has been the ordained Ministry of Word and Sac ram ent and pastoral care
And there is no intention to dispense with this kind of service
But concern is expressed in the number of jobs that the perfect minister is expected to do
I stand here I am not a perfect minister because I am over forty I've got children that are not too awkward but er m could be awkward and I haven't a spouse ah and ah I stand here saying that I'm not good at everything I'm good with young people I'm not o only good with old people I try to do my best
We know the picture of a perfect minister but we there is a challenge to relief ministers to do the work that they are called to do
This will lead to a long de ba debate
But it is it seems from this report that is in front of us that it is now appropriate for the U RC to take a new step with regard to the local ministry of elders
Already this morning the question has been asked about providing elders
And it is that each local church of whatever sign should be invited to nominate from amongst their elder division those elders who district council might consider and recognise as dividing elders for a stated period of years with authority to do provide them all services of worship and meetings of that local church as the need arises
And this has been suggested the same thing the understanding that we have now of special authorization which obviously doesn't work
The reasons for looking at this change and I quote the reports the the ways the district council interpret the existing clause about pro vi precede n cy is the district council ah interpret in very different ways
A second thing is that a co is it right that a company of people should be deprived of a sac ram ent because an ordained minister is not available
Remembering the words of Jesus that where two or three are gathered together
The third thing that the re the report says is that there is no magical element about sac ram ents
But sac ram ent has everything to do with the grace of God and the faith of the church
And this proposal is seen last ly as developing local leadership
The proposal is that presiding elders and whether proposal is the right word but the suggestion that presiding elders be appointed following our conviction that every local church should have regular sac ra mental worship with presiding with people presiding being allowed
Can I close by saying that every time Christians share the Lord's supper they are publicly declaring their needs to be fed with the living bread and wine
What does the holy communion what the Lord's supper mean to you
and our visitors from other church es are also welcome to join in in any discussion or comments
And any more for those who feel like it there's provision for
Sorry
Anyone who's visiting from other church es
And we lack provisions that allows for a presidency in the absence of a minister is a good one as long as it is monitored closely by district council
And be that there no magical er m like you which I agree there is a mystical
Like it isn't you know that the E uc har is ter the the the communion is very central to our worship and having had ten years working at the Navy that was an eye opener and deep en ing of my own spiritual awareness in the as in the sanctity that I got the sac ram ent and how other church es see it and er helped to create a very af firm at the very centre of my own if you like pilgrimage
What had abhor red me in the past and sometimes er perhaps arrive and been to the church and say oh by the way it's communion
And have that sprung on me I I I I I feel terrible because the communion service i is is something I have to prepare for in myself and obviously shape the whole se se service around it
And I think we need to height en sharpen our awareness of er m what I understand by communion and er er also to er to remember that the injunction of Paul as he was you know that I have received of the Lord at which I deliver unto you
Those words of execution as we continue to read them
There's a severe warning against those who can't do it in a spirit of of of la rd i ness and and not discerning to the body and and and the will of Christ
Perhaps that needs to be reminded about them
But they sho er er er it's good to have and sharing it but I but I but I I personally feel as long as it's well monitored within the within the district council in the event of a minister not being able to be there then er a rec o er som a recognised person to
Right when we
Who who are you
Oh you ask difficult questions that's all you can get
No giants in A rd more Vale
No giants in A rd more Vale
You'd make do that
See Is it me

Ah
I've forgotten what I was gonna say
Yep
Er m oh yes my next question was er what is holy communion
I'd like to re - p h r a s e the question what is holy in communion
Okay well I mean
do we say what is holy in communion we then recognise that it's not what but who who is holy in communion okay
The holy as in communion to me is a who not a what
Okay
And I think that debate er between the the tradition and and the the and and er Roman Catholic traditions you know i er this business of el eva ting the host and and subs tant i at i on so the elements themselves that that it become holy alright
And then it's a kind of a what you know
It's the body of a what and the blood as a what
Have you read
But that's not it
And that's not what Paul meant when he said the body of a what
He meant who
That is holy
And who is holy
Jesus Christ
Alright
You wanted it and that's it
When two or three are doubted they're wrong
So what's the who
That's the holy to me
And the other who of holy is the Saint
I'm making this point because I think that we can get really to verify
You're always going on about
You know this whole of idea of things and ritual being the holy and that things in the ritual there yes there are sacred symbols and they need to be handled in that that that sense of sacred ness but the that which makes them sacred is the person our Lord and us in communion with him and with each other and it seems to me that wherever that happens there is sac ram ent
Wherever that happens there is holy communion
Even if the elements aren't even present
Okay
But I think I think those elements are important otherwise Jesus wouldn't have made a point of it
David East Wales
Can I clarify please what exactly we are talking about here
Because the do document Patterns of Ministry does not talk about lay presidency
It talks about the presidency of ordained people
Elders who are ordained
Now I rather wish it was talking about lay presidency and I would go along with N annette on the question of a lay person presiding in communion
E cu men ical dynamite I know
But I think we need to be clear whether we are talking about ordained or lay people and further on in the discussion whether we can indeed justify that division
How can try and allow an elder as an ordained minister of the free people
Can I say that need holy communion as a group thing in a way of our communion and as a church we are going to be Roman Catholic
It is the community as a an af firm at i on of the community and to say that we need to have an outsider in to do that because there is not an ordained minister there to me is a little like the situation in some An gl i can Paris hes where there's a woman sitting
We will move on
I'm allowed to say something pilgrimage of love and the parish knows that too because something that er it's
So the three words that's come to my mind immediately are go and do
And you will recognise them as the words of Jesus
They are direct they're clear they're simple and most importantly they are words of one syllable
But they still have a conscience and they challenge that they
Now the the annual assembly has challenged us to engage in what is called integrated trading
Personally I prefer to speak about learning together because I think it's more friendly use er user friendly I think I understand it better and it reminds me that it's connected with disciple - s h i p
Because I'm quite sure that the young people this morning everyone would know that the word disciple means
Follower isn't it
Well you're all shy aren't you
yes
Means a learn er
Now the word disciple means learn er
So that we're all involved disciple - s h i p is integral l yer learning is integral to our disciple - s h i p
And we are involved not just spasm od i call y or occasionally but continuously
And learning together as we've been reminded more than once than this morning engage s us all i r respective of age i r respective of experience it engage s everyone and it's worth emphasis ing that the quality of learning does not depend upon the size of a congregation
And I say that in a right of some statistics that appear in today's agenda
The quality of learning depends upon the measure of our response and of our commitment s
It involves sharing our gifts with each other freely and generous ly
It means er m learning with each other and learning from each other because none of us knows it all
And I think also it means being open open to one another and open with one another
And when you put all that together I think we would recognise that there is no single of learning that suits every congregation because congregation s differ one from the other
And we remind ourselves that the spirit is also infinitely ver sat i le and flexible in its activity
But when we consider learning together are a model
To use an educational term it's an active model it's an active model of model of partnership and of sharing
Patterns of Ministry to my mind can be interpreted as patterns of sharing and partnership is active and not fussy
Partnership is creative and not rigid
Partnership is dynamic and not
And then learning together is a model of dynamic encounter or dialogue one with the other
And by that I mean that we engage one another in a process
We cannot all as it already been emphasis ed by the last speaker we may not all be able to do the same things we have not all got the same gifts or the same responsibilities er within the church but you all have the same responsibilities in this light of God
And that implies that our learning together engage s us in dynamic encounter dynamic dialogue which also releases some of those energies in various areas of life that would otherwise be sealed or indeed locked
And I were to guess that learning together is also a model of rich and diverse possibilities
There is no one who can foresee what are the ultimate results
Or what is the ultimate outcome of any learning process
There is no blueprint that one could lay down but with a on the infinite ver sat ility of God to use and deploy the gifts that we are able to offer to his service
The Holy Spirit is also flexible and progressive in operation
And therefore in learning together there are rich and diverse possibilities
And I would suggest through us learning together is a model of effective ev angel is m
For ev angel is m at best is a congregation learning together
Learning together for the word
Learning together for the sac ram ent
Learning together through prayer and worship and all the activities of the church
Learning together by entering entering into the experience of one or the other and also engaging the community around the church not superficial ly but er realistically
And it would seem to me that unless this morning's exercise which has been so rewarding and so profitable unless this morning's exercise is to dissipate into another piece of feeling and er pleasurable discussion then we ought to take quite seriously the the words of Jesus
Go and do
And see whether we can no we could put this matter of learning together that every member of of our church high on the agenda
Well at the next er elders meeting the next church meeting the next district council
or whatever
We'll move on
And read the please six and visions from Vis cuss The first one is going to be given a bit more time and then the other five are going to brief
And we'll ask Christian who's er m an elder
Yesright
In G arm on chat y to share an experience of their church in terms of using ministry
A ministry that we don't often think of as a ministry
Correct sir

Erin the introductions I didn't stand up and er introduce myself cos I felt it would steal a few minutes of my er presentation
This is re it is my first visit to a
My name's Chris I'm from the river town U RC in just down the road
What we've been embarking on in the er the U RC church in Shod den is er budget ing the title of my talk today is budget ing for growth
We hear about bud gets in all walks of life indeed we saw a red box only a few days ago
I'm afraid I've only got a little red one
This will happen next week
So we've had the most famous budget of all
I suppose you could argue that his budget was era budget for growth but my discussion this morning is apolitical
But I'll make not comment on his budget at all
The basic principle of a budget is straightforward it's to forecast your forecast your ex p end expenses so they can make plans for the future
Big and lit little businesses a like budget for growth
It enables them to make most most cost - e f f e c t i v e use of their resources
So why shouldn't a church do the same
On this approach following a presentation and a discussion led by the Reverend Bill about eighteen months ago
And I've written this paper not to give information and details on how you do budget
There are plenty of papers and books and guidance from the U RC to help you do that
What I'd like to share with you this morning is how we as a church took that challenge and the experiences we feel we've received from taking that challenge
We have begun to feel the benefit
Well how was it at er Shod den Well like any other church we thought we were doing well
We were just getting enough money in to do just enough in the church
The church was helping the spirit
Helping in kind
Helping the fellowship
What more as a church could we ask for
Well maybe they can like any other church was the an or is the Annual Church ge the Annual General Meeting and as John pointed out this morning of course we look at what we've done in the past
The finances the well being of our own flock what we have done
But look at the tense it's what have done
It's a re t ro spec t ive view
That is important we learn from experiences
But it's what we've done in the past
What about the future
How many of us actually in our church meeting look forward to what we want to do
Where's the direction of your church
Where's the direction of your fellowship that they can follow
Are there any problems that may be looming on the horizon that perhaps you ought to be addressing before they reach the door
We need to grow together and enjoy the experience together
So what changed us
Well the presentation by Bill helped in supporting provided was the
We've heard it all before
But not at any time in the context of the church
A number of us went to that presentation the minister the church secretary myself and the treasurer at the time and a few of the elders
We listened and learned that if the church is to grow it must consider all its resources
Reference to that again this morning
We must tap that wealth with talent
I suppose really we learn by who sent us that evening
A sense of purpose a sense of involvement a sense of direction a sense of satisfaction and a sense of achievement
We're beginning to experience all those
And I suppose we also experience a sixth sense
A sense of humour
we've heard that again this morning
And Bill in there used sense of humour to get some of his points over
But we've got all of those
talk from any of you
If you look closely at that to what depth to what depth do those senses reach in your church
Our church has money to spend on on anything fabric fellowship worship mission the list is endless
What a delightful ness to choose from
But what priority do you sign to it
Which one do you choose
How much on each of those
One of the problems you may be facing in your church is inertia the feeling that we're doing fine everything's ticking over
But remember the same effort reap s the same reward
So we returned from that evening together and were very enthusiastic about what we heard
The seed was sown in good soil
The treasurer indeed faces the same old
task every year to ask church members to give a little bit more to pay the bills
What a depressing thing to ask for
Just to keep up with in flat i on
Just to keep the wolf from the door
Wouldn't you generate a more positive attitude if you were aligned your increase or the request for an increase through the a an increase in activity in the church itself
That is true growth
So what did we do
Well first of all we told the people at the earliest opportunity we told the church members what we've learnt told them about our of the advantages and our enthusiasm and commitment to the process
We tried the process
We selected a single project to just learn how to do it just go through the process simply
It took about nine months of planning from start to finish on the one project we did
We had a programme on four con se cut ive Saturdays last October help reach the
At not a significant cost
It's a significant step for our fellowship
And the benefit is we want to do it again this year that's great
Plus taking keeping it and doing it if you see benefit in that
So that was a benefit to people outside and people inside the church
We have learnt at getting a number of people into our congregation
So that was our first success when we decided that process
Forward planning and setting objective s were a good way to focus attention
So we set objective s and sub subsequently planned a budget to ensure that it's successful
So what's the timetable
Well I'll take you back six months
The elders were advised in advance that we were going to discuss the future
This enabled the elder ship to start thinking about what we want to do next year to grow together
So in the next elders meeting we used a management technique brain storm er s think the say what you think
And we gathered all this information we group ed it into those cat eg or i es admission worship and such like
Then later couple of months later when we found that list checked that we understood what the list meant and we presented that list to our church meeting
This will ensure that there's commitment and that the direction is understood for the next year
So in that presentation discussions followed and that list of nine things I think it was surprise surprise the church wanted to do all nine
Now there's a challenge
So what we did then is we went to do to do fact - f i n d i n g c o s t s p e o p l e resources effort and any options that might be open to us
And the cu l mi nation of the production of some financial information that simply enables you to ensure that you can meet those goals in that coming year if you choose to do so
So at the Annual Annual General Meeting it was conducted i very much in the same way as before presenting the previous year's activities but this time we presented a budget
Very similar to the example that Bill provided in his hand out s
We listed a our expenditure his forecast we used the forecast based on experience and in flat i on
Some of them are at best guesses
But then you foil a new project to your expenditure and say look if you want to do these as indeed you've expressed then it's going to cost you so much
If you get that agreement there one hopes you get that commitment
On a technicality the bu the treasurer can still control it
He can measure every clause of what the in come is against what the expenditure is so that we have some control to ensure that the church life grows and we don't stumble
So we have true growth
What are finally what are the benefits that we've seen here
Well if there's a commercial activity you could argue that but i in the chu context of the church what have we achieved
We have focus we have a direction we maintain the fis cal control we are aware of what we're doing as a church we have the the members commitment indeed we have their involvement in what we want to do
It is future planning it is growth it is commended to you all
And I'd like to leave you with one last statement just enough but just enough is not enough
Thank you
We're going to now from first of all I'll say it in order and then you can come up
Jean from South Wales come on Jean
Then Russell from East Wales then Henry for North Wales then from West Wales and Becky from Mid - W a l e s
Can you remember your names
Your yo
Okay
Right
It's going to be
Jean you've got the floor for ten minutes
Oh
Jean
Er I'm Jean from Mert hy r Ty d f il and I'm the secretary on the committee
Within the South Wales district the question education can always as well as trying to help and support carry pe I've worked in junior church es and many more education church es
It's very much concerned with the training and Ministry of Elders and a few weeks ago a part of our programme we held a very successful and lively meeting on the subject of church membership
It was initiated by one of our ministers er m who felt it would be useful for church es to share er their procedures for preparation for church membership
As he said I know what I do with my congregation but how do others er approach the subject
Under the leadership of the Reverend Kenneth this meeting developed into a much wider consideration of the leaning and significance of church membership
Does it begin with infant baptism
Are all children and me and adults who have been b apt is ed members of the church is not or you'll be actually encouraged or pressured to misinterpret the membership or should we wait for them to be informed er er to wait for them to to feel the
One or two elders confessed that they have not been b apt is ed
And others were not sure whether they had
So what about them
We realise that this is a subject which warrants much consideration as we think about the life and revere n ce of our church es and look to the future for
And we hope that our district will continue to be be aware of ways in in which we may help elders and church es in their ministry
Thank you
Russell
Russell East Wales district
Er m I'd like to tell you a story about a vision of Ministry in East Wales
When I'm about to tell you a story I thought to myself well stories that Jesus used to tell were parable s and when I looked at them in the bible they had a kingdom meaning to them
And I thought to myself yes I'll tell you a story
I'll tell you a story about a place I went
Now so much more time has been released for us to be the church but at the same time we have nowhere to hide and nothing to blame
It has meant that church es need to be bold and be young or a threat to what we belong to as the edges between church and and community have blurred we are now much more vulnerable
Somebody said like a tortoise without a shell
And we need a greater trust in God
It has also meant a greater love for one another as we can share our faith and come face to face with who we are
I'm glad that Pat used the word exciting but all the story you've heard this morning are exciting
But it does Pat doesn't it also danger
It also means fear it also means pain
I don't know no any more what church is I don't know any more and I'm supposed to come this morning and help to discover what unity is
It blurred so much and in the blur ring we have discovered our own vu l ner abilities
And having raised our banner s of church proudly a change is all what changes should have been
I see now narrow minded ness I see the death ed ness I see suspicion of other communities I see jealousies
However I am discovering that the church probably not the community but more a communion and that's perhaps an answer to what N an ette
Or within the communion of our Lord Jesus Christ in word and sac ram ent and that living out of his love is his body and finding community
Communion actually the Holy Communion has become so much more important to us and so much more exciting to us because we're not just celebrating the living Christ we're also celebrating the crucified Christ and we're simply meeting our pain and our joys together in communion with him
I once watched a film on the telly it was a pretty crap film really
It was American no sorry it's not
See yes the thing about community
It was a simple story and I would of forgotten it er about a woman struggling to bring up a family in a depression
The story was that her husband in the deep south was killed by some young hoodlums who were black
She was left to bring up a family she had to go the banks for money the banks were all and they refused her money to keep the farm going
She took on a black lad and because she did that she was o s t r ac is ed from the rest of the community
He eventually was driven off the farm but the respectable white people who went to church
The story of course was a happy ending that she struggled on and she did it
But for some strange reason and I don't know whether they direct it to Christian the last shot of the film almost un notice able because the credits were going up she went back into church and it was a communion service and all you saw was her receiving the bread and passing the plate and the plate was to the young black lad on the farm and you thought he's come back
But then no he passed the plate then to the woman's husband who had been killed
And then the plate was passed from him to his murderer and it was passed round until it was passed to the bank manager who wouldn't give her the money and then back to her
And somehow but I can't explain it in that moment that what community's about it's about the not yet as well your
About the journey being on and the recon c ilia tion o of them
And that's where we are and this morning
Thank you
We thank you to everybody who's contributed to to our speaking this morning
There's a lot for you to talk about over lunch
And on the journeys home
Just a reminder that er m expenses and apologies should be given to Suzanne or Eileen
Er m if any have been those elders or ministers will advise us the days they are going to come those ministers who are and seen if we do so that we can remember whom our chosen
Downstairs there is a books tall and there's a today upstairs
Bon app et it
Oh dear my batteries are going flat
Oh no it's alright
Er m
So what are you trying it out for somebody are you
No er
We to were you recording
I've been doing doing so
You have
Now you won't about the W rex ham
Er yes
Did you have did you read those words
Er yes I just glanced through it
Oh
Well actually there's no decision yet from the church meeting
Yeah
so we've still got to

Yesbut they could
And they could
sell it
I mean my favourite but
Mm
And it was a major problem of finance it seems to me when you've two possible avenue s left to take
When you I think it's yes
One is getting a loan from the church
Mm
and re paying it at five percent interest or whatever is a rate of
Yes
fare
And there's no guarantee they'll they'll lend it
If they ask for money
The other is to apply to come back that I the interest that I
I was told that o over a year ago but I haven't found any yet
I see
I've got a lot of information about tru charitable trusts but all
I can't see that any one of them which is you know would have that as one of the things
I see
Now I haven't finished but I mean I it really is at the top of my mind yo you know it hasn't I haven't given it top priority
Well you've got a lot of other things to think about I'd say
Well all the other things have been more urgent so therefore I haven't really pursued it to its limits
Mm
So you know if if you find there's a position for when they absolutely need help you know phone me again or write to me again and tell me you've you've you've set everything
Well keep in touch
But well I mean I it's a so far I really don't push
I see
I've got the names of lots of
Mm
I'll try to get started
But you know if you need some I can't any of them a as being willing to
Mm mm
In the pipeline
But there may something at the there might
Oh there mi there might be
I think might be because it's a the four church es to ge together
That's right
If it need it to share the cost of the new one but once it goes on the
Sa
four church es
Yes
and not on the one
and er also therefore you'll have the if you like
Yeah
or
I wish some other church es would come and
Well we'll be stuck into finding a finance man er to watch the cost over the
You need
Yeah I mean
You've gotta look at the same as
Have you got
Er m in the personals
to me
and the personal situation now is that economic climate get a house how many are talking here
sometimes from a
Like you'd better can I get rid of these
Please
Would you be able stay with the one you've got
Well the one we've got above our in fact there's one next door to us going for sale at the moment and they're asking advertised prices else you'll be getting about fifty thousand on top that's ours
It was a short she wants fifty thousand pound for
And because that one even if we didn't rule out it says fifteen forty
Mm
And it seems for the church es we'd then be looking up to point forty per c fourteen percent for fifty thousand pounds
A actually John was suggesting that we might talk nicely to John's dad about the money they've got invested in the sale of their pro their ground
I don't know how far we'd get but er it's worth looking at
The only thing is though I mean you see but I think the church itself and I would say the church as the group now
Mm
would be looking at that as a more meaningful contribution to
Mm
Well what else can you talk
So to be able to the sweeps take in the past another church and they could be they could be on the interest you know the amount towards running costs such as this
Well to me running costs wouldn't be and the cost of towards borrowing a house is the same way you know
Well exactly
The point is that looks very nice
Yeah
You know but I mean if the church cannot find contributions it really can't
Well you see like like
Exactly
Yes well er m we're still going to have to talk about it with the elders you see
Sorry what did you say
We're still going to have to talk about with the e with the
With the
joint elders group
Yes yes yes yes
Er m
Quite right
which meets on Monday
Er so I might be in touch with you after that
Oh right
But I mean even now you can you can read that thing out to me
Yes
I mean that that was you er goals you know
No no messing I mean I did that ages ago and I i it just arrived
I think I was already in
Did you have a good holiday by the way
Lovely holiday thank you
But I wa but I was there for a fortnight and when I came back I you know it's preparing for S y nod just takes all the time we have somehow and I
Oh yes
I I was only off the plane just last week I'd better have a look at this
Yeah
dear dear dear
Just a mi matter of interest where do you come from because on this dictionary thing I'm supposed to put down what people's local accent is
Ah that's good
Only Oxford no I'm mine is in in in expl i cable because I've lived in so many places and I pick up accents
I was born in L an cash i re so that's
Mm
the basis of it all
I've had the roughest edges knocked off it when I went to University
And the but then I went to live in Northern Ireland so I've got a so picked up a fair bit of Northern Ireland
Yes well it does happen when whe
Cos it's a hybrid it's an old
It
it does happen when you move around
Yeah it does
In I think it happened to me to some extent
Well it does if if if you pick up accents some people never change
That's true
some people doesn't matter where you go they never change
But if you are at all I mean yo you I think you pick up reflections
Mm
You know I haven't been consciously s tru s t r iv ing to change my accent
In fact you know I'm consciously now not to become a Welsh accent because if I've got the Welsh accent added to it all it'll be horrendous
But er
Right
I have
Yeah
isn't it
Yes
It's at least distinctive
It is
On the notice you sent out the other day for Monday 's meeting
Yes
I think you put a paragraph first that said maybe we will need to consider our recommendation
Yes
and the of course you went on to to number one the man's two er group secretary who draws it out I forgot what the other one was
Yes
Maybe in some thing which at the moment is that the be number one
Er which wo which one you mean the
Well tha tha that number one be the question on recommendation
I see
Oh yes
Well I was thinking that
Yeah
But it really is it might have got lost in the paragraph might en it
Cos when the comes underneath
I see what you mean
It isn't being critical at all but on this position situation that might the first thing that we
Oh yes I was assuming that er m a I do I didn't really set it out as a formal agenda just as a
Just as a note
a reminder like
Er m I don't know what the situation will be in the other church es
Mm
And I must say between us at the moment there wasn't a strong feeling what it's all about
Not a strong feeling in favour
No
No I'm only saying as prepared with
Mm

Well er m
I mean this is nothing to do with a don't worry that's we don't want them thinking that the house is the issue cos it isn't alright
The house what rate is
Yes
Whether there are the
No I th i
which er m we had an elders meeting on Thursday and between Sunday and Thursday various people have comments and people along
Mm
on Saturday or Sunday er m there was er m a tale at the elders meeting on su sub version and overall feelings er m er m that we wouldn't
Oh
That's a pity
Yeah well that's er mI mean the only talking is between us at the moment it's just you know
If of course on Monday that's a vote a recommendation is taken
Mm
you know we would accept a rec o whatever the Monday 's meeting was
Yes
We we wouldn't mean sticking out of the wood and saying no
Yeah but
In fact report back just all about meeting and say
Bu but o on the other hand yo you've got to se you've to er give the information that you have about the feeling in the church
Yes
In fact we i it would expressed interest it will be expressed a week on Monday
Yes
Er m I mean I I I don't know I mean i it's not not it's not my business to even look
Oh yes
one way or the other
I it's simply my business to sort of help the works
See mm it that's true yes
That if it's as well well before the meeting Monday because at the end of the day you know we we gotta look at the matter going forward isn't it
Yes
You know is going forward to a week on Sunday and then whatever else happens we're going through the process aren't we
And having this all come on Monday thinking that everything is we gotta to the church we're feeling well if we don't go through now where do we go
Well I don't I don't think that should influence them too much
I mean it one wants to get a settlement quickly
Mm
but it's more important to get the right person than to do it
Well cer
quickly
well certain things like John there
Mm
a number of people
Mm
and then what's it amount to
If I use the word aggression
Yes
I mean they
It just came over in his sermon on Sunday morning
It's cos I wasn't for that
Weren't you
No
Still he quoted that he'd dealt with in his past
Mm
And people felt there was an aggressive ness a about him
Mm
And in trying to bring these four church es together it would be a li you know not
A lot of tact may be needed at times yes
And you could see them all so nervousness anxiety that I wasn't told about
And unfortunately this
First can we have you back in the church
we've had this problem in the past with John
And with makes
Ooh
Ooh
makes you wo wary
Mm mm
and cautious
Yes well er m I mean you can't help being aware of past experiences
Everybody back in the church
There again
please in two minutes
in getting trying to bring the four together again
Starting again in two minutes
Mm
Back in
you'd wanna make sure yo the right role of leadership is needed and er certainly this helps in that as well
Even when
Er just more negative
Well that seems to be the mood
Well what the church meeting's got to decide
the church meeting will have to
It's the church meeting's final decision
I mean even if even i even if the elders recommend positively if the church meeting goes against it well that's it

But er m on the other hand we we've gotta try as a group of elders to come together I
Mm
must admit
To see what goes
Er m some of us may go to tomorrow and
Mm
That'd be a good idea I think
Perhaps in some way yes
Er m I I feel by going to cos sometimes they're more involved than these days
Than than in talk with God
Yep
yes
Well not that isn't how it but
Oh no I know what you mean
and I got a greater kinship because they're a small group
Mm
And I go there every month
Mm
So you know I do feel quite involved in what they're doing and they're they will readily come and share with you
Nice
You know
And we'll see we'll see what goes
And I I thought it's where we've we could share the minutes together before Monday 's meeting
Right well
In in this situation we've all and again the who implication not only W rex ham but
Oh yes
Er but we we wasn't sure for North Wales that it's the type
Mm
What is the right situation
You know basically by en large we don't know
Right well
We will see you se seven thirty on Monday isn't it
Yes yes I'm
Then it's then it's Friday again afterwards
Okay all the best
Er it's er Kevin isn't it
Yes
Yes Kevin Kevin er I don't know whether but she's none too well
Ah
Oh I'm sorry
Er m I'm trying to find somebody about getting this put right
Mm
But she's had men in git is back which is a bit tricky for old health
Mm
So whether she'd like some I don't know
Right
Hello
In our last meeting John the need to do a little thing that would the district but I felt that because of the time pushing that wha what's his name has said about the er m the River
Yes
adventure was probably enough that er m I would have flown a kite and one or two things otherwise
So I felt because the time was pushing passing so much and the
Yes
that was
and I naturally er I thought Chris gave a good report
When's yeah
Well it was practically the same as he did at district wasn't
Yeah
it
Yeah
Oh it's very articulate very good
Mm
I didn't know he was gonna be here
Er m oh well maybe yours can be saved up for another time
Mm
That's it
Mind you don't step on the
Oh I'm sorry
No I didn't like to go and step on the
Er can I hang this up and no so as not to take it into the church
Where can I
Well where where do you wanna hang it up
Ooh sorry
Sorry
Here we are put it there
Yeah
Right
Alright
W oops
Thank you
Thank you very much
If I forget it it's not desperate but I'd like to take it
What are you taking it
Ah switch it off
Right that goes in upside down like that
Mode rat or and friends let me say first of all that I'm glad to be able to make these speeches on behalf of the member church es of and I'd like to also on particularly on behalf of the England and Wales though I did realise having said that that you have a minister of the University of Pen ry th is also a member of this S y nod and therefore you've got me three things
Er
I greet you greet you on on behalf of these
And but I I'm glad to make a greeting from a a wide range of church es er m I've got to dis card this figure because I've got
But including church es that are Ort hod ox church and the Lutheran Lutheran church es in Wales and now hopefully during this year some sanctity church es in Wales
And so that there will be a a broad spectrum of people who with us confess a common faith serve a common Lord and pro claim about our gospel serving within this number of people in Wales and therefore I'm glad to bring you greetings for that reason
I'm glad to bring you greetings because I think you serve a particularly unimportant purpose
When when I was asked to comment be before John was was ever elected er m is that you elect mode rat or s from e whatever happened to a mode rat or
Be before you were chosen by whatever process a number of us was asked to comment and one of the things I felt it important to say was that the U RC plays a very important role both in being a bridge between all these nations but also serving a particular reform tradition within Wales
And that this larger responsibility having more local responsibility combined in one small church is an important role
But I think that came through in this morning's conversation
And I'm glad also to to to greeting it's my last part John if you'd like to know
Er m be because out of that debate this morning I sense you have much to offer the rest of us and I hope that that conversation will not be a conversation confined your S y nod or to the to the assembly of U RC but that we'll find ways of sharing that perception of ministry with those of us in other church es cos you don't need me to tell me tell you that that key question in the whole e cu men ical debate not just in these nations but worldwide and I think that from within this reform tradition in which I share I will hope that we will find ways of offering that perception of ministry in all its forms as er ma symbol and a sign of the ministry of the whole people of God we have that to offer the church es in Wales and worldwide and I hope that we can find ways of doing that
And for those reasons and for the fact that I more or less enjoyed the journey and had to come anyway as a chauffeur
Thank you Noel
We move to the E cu men ical group it's on page number fourteen
Page four on page four
Thank you mode rat or
Having read the S y nod class letter I will assume you haven't acted on it and therefore rule resolution one
You will see this report for debate
Not half
If there are no questions on the paragraph s of the report not covered by resolution s
Are there any questions or comments on paragraph s one or three or four on wards
No
In that case resolution s
I then resolution two which is continuing the process that we were introduced to the last S y nod and the previous S y nod consideration of the endless discussion document on Christian initiation
I hope
anybody wish to speak to this in will you any visitors
Silence the resolution s before you and the second the working party and to consider and coordinate from to endless
All those in favour
Any against
I think it's important also that having done that that also replies the eagerness and activity in which it was
Ha
about the whole process of Christian initiation
I mean having done that we haven't yet set up a working party and let the rest of the world forget about us
As one seems possible
Number three please
Resolution three concerns the agreed procedure and service for the ord in at the electoral statement held as a United United Reform Presbyterian Church of Wales church es
I all had hoped to be able to bring before you a final draft of th the service it has not yet finally been passed by the Presbyterian Church of Wales therefore discussions on what form and how it will be printed have not yet taken place
So you've got the latest draft with the latest amendment s those of you who have taken one to se look at it
If you haven't I assume you trust the U RC doctorate worship committee and e cu men ical at home committee and the group
Oh ha
Absolute
I am happy to let those er m t ra procedures of the election a lord i nation and induction of elders in joint U RC Presbyterian Church of Wales
Yes
Question
Yes only one question I've got please
Ere rm
Under the line
Oh Sorry
I di
Within the next er month or so a national consultation is being held within the U RC to consider the advice of producing a programme of training for elder ship which will be used throughout the call of the church and if there are any suggestions or any proposal that anyone would like to make I shall be very glad to receive them within the next month
Thank you
Any other questions or comments
And you
Yesbut I'll try to be brief
As I understand things and I work from what I know to what I don't know anyone ordained an elder following these guidelines is recognised as an elder within the United Reform Church and within the Presbyterian Church of Wales
As a result of that and I think to make sure this is something we would have to ask the advisory committee but I would read it that that includes mutual recognition of elder ship
And so in my
That it would yes
But I'd want to consult the giant advisory committee before putting that into print
Yo that's an important question that comes as a we can attempt or the group can attempt to answer that question the in reports of the next so we don't lose it off the agenda
Yes
Would that be fair
Yes
I'll just put that aside
All in those in favour of the resolution that we commend to these to the church
we agree the procedure for the election of ord i nation and induction of elders in and in church es
Please show
Any against
Actually I've rather hur ried through that objective part of our I only had my time to bring before you one other very important issue and two other pieces of information
There are a few copies remaining of news letter
There's also information about the International E cu men ical Fellowship which is something that you as an individual can do to support e cu men ical work
If you want to know more about it pick up a leaf let
If we have run out of leaf lets pick up John
Because he is a member and he can tell you about it
The most important thing in this report is from the Council of Church es for Britain and Ireland and it's a resolution that they passed on Northern Ireland
You should have this received this in the pew when you came in this morning
The reason it is important today is because tomorrow has been requested to be appointed to be a special day in prayer for peace justice in Northern Ireland
Like this resolution I would urge all of you when you go back to your congregation those ministers who are following the mode rat or 's request those ministers from the South who will not be conducting morning worship tomorrow because of the long journey request whoever is conducting worship to use this in the service in the prayers
Those of you who are here without ministers badger your minister
When you get back tonight or tomorrow to include this in your time and prayer in one of your services tomorrow
And don't let it stop there
A day of prayer is important as it changes our pattern of prayer and as it changes our concerns week by week and year by year
Some of the attempts at peace making the church es in Ireland are making may seem worrying may seem politically subversive but how will we respond to the longing for peace to the desire for recon c ilia tion for the hope the stakes that will result in a permanent and just solution
I commend to you all this
of prayer
And will move that this document be taken back to your local church es and used
We
We move to page five the top half of page five and and Graham will introduce the world famous issue
Having c re credit by David 's withering look I always say you have to be terrified
It's a bit
I'm a spy
Oh after all that it didn't work
It's at this point in our agenda when er the world search it's our agenda and er in introducing the report there are just four things I want to comment about
Er I refer first of all to the continuing links we have with the church in Hun gary and to remind that there is a a party of young who are currently negotiating the er visit to Hun gary at this present time
And er we would hope that that programme of rec i pro cal visits will continue over the ensuing years
We also find there are and I hope that you will read it carefully because I think you will find it a fairly d aunt ing report which comes from Hugh who has managed you know has been work in germ in er Romania with the Bishop er m who more or less kind of started off the or whose work started off the the revolution that took place in Romania
Within that report he tells us er m the rather startling disturbance story that in fact it almost suggests has been suggested the revolution hasn't happened because the situation has continued as before with a different name but basically with the same er with the same kind of programme intact
And in the creation of unity unity there's deep concern about the status of American church es in Romania and obviously the Hungarian church in Romania is affected by that whole process so I would urge you to read that letter to remember the work of Hugh er m and to be aware of of what the situation is in that part of the world
It seems important that I should have links in developing links you ought to see that as part of our agenda
Hugh himself I think he is completing his work and there in in a few months time and I know there have attempts made to find someone to replace him
As yet er that has not been possible but if you knew of anybody young person who you thought might be suitable and might mi might like the challenge of an interesting venture of this nature I'm sure if you let us know or let the mode rat or know we'll be very happy to er suggest that name or see if there's any any possibility er min continuing that
We also feel it's important that we should be doing just a bit more than just having ex changes that there is a whole process of that needs to go on
There's an assumption by some politicians that just because there is this immense change taking place in Eastern Europe that this is victory for Western capitalism er mI think there might be some of who might be a bit cautious about that victory and might believe that er there is still much that needs to be shared and understood and it isn't as simple as perhaps some political figures might suggest it could be
So I want to first of all in presenting this report to remind you of the importance of that link and for us to encourage its development
Secondly the World Church er m is your agenda in the sense that you might be interested to know there is a er m a video now available er which introduces the work of C W M for the church es
And that video can be obtained from Ta vi stock Church in Ta vi stock Place it costs twelve pound fifty with one pound fifty postage er m but I think that it has been recommended to us and a number of the province s have asked for copies to be made available and then maybe there are some church es within our proven ce that might like to have that video so that they can draw the attention of their church es to the work of the Council for World Mission
Third ly we will in a moment be hearing a report er m about the World Council of Church es assembly which took place in Can ber ra so there is another aspect to the World Church hitting our agenda today
But fourth and I think it was reflected very much in the discussions this morning just to simply remind you that you are the World Church
You know we sometimes think of the World Church as being something that's out there beyond us but we are the World Church aren't we
We're we are part of the that process and it's it's sometimes encouraging for us to remember that there are small de nomination s small groups like us around the world who are struggling to make their Christian witness real in their particular context
And it's important that the kind of story that we're being told this morning or to continue to be told we are to continually hear and observing
stories because they are encouraging it does make us feel that even though we are a small de nomination that does not stop us from preventing new ideas which we can share and in which we can learn from each other
So I would hope that out of this experience of this morning you will continue to er let some of those stories come forward and and let us hear them and let us share in them
And with those comments mode rat or I'd like to present the er report of the World Church Church and Mission
Are there any questions either on the report or in what
Then it gives me great pleasure now to er m I always knew that John al has had something different from the rest of us you know he has that kind of air doesn't he that that status in the pulp it which you know
And of course I've now discovered what it i she's a distant relative of the Archbishop of Wales
There was always er there was always something there
There was just something about his daring
that's alright then
I'm not gonna do that John
Er m I'm I'm never sure about Bishop s and Archbishop se rm I remember Archbishop Run c i e once commenting about er an activity that took place at the installation of a Bishop and it's I gather I mean I've I haven't actually been to one but if you're Bishop or an Archbishop when they act to the triumph and act of installation took place there were you'll find that the person was surrounded by Bishop s and they were all sort of looking in on this er this body that was gonna be installed and somebody once asked what are they doing
Ar Archbishop Run Run c i e said well it's just simply an operation to remove their backbone
Er m I don't know
I would like to er say that we are very grateful today to be able to welcome amongst us his grace er m the most rev erent Al w y n who has just recently been elected as the Archbishop of Wales
We're delighted that you have found time out of your busy schedule and timetable to come and spend time with us today and we're very glad that you are able to do so and I would ask er John our mode rat or if he will receive me now and invite you to address our
Well first of all may I respond positively to those kind words of welcome that you extended to me
At least I feel at home
I won't say any more
Some of you may have listened very attentive ly to the to a programme that put o was put out a week ago I think with Betty erin Welsh and er some of you therefore will know something my background
Er last year and time has flown hasn't it
Last February twelve months last February I'm I was privileged to travel to Can ber ra in Australia fortunately not on my own because there are wi witnesses
Er
There were seven of us from Wales er and two of them are present here this afternoon
Noel was present and presenting the Welsh independence in and also Get hy n was present er m I'd like to see er know that Get hy n was representing the Church in Wales apart from the fact that he's also a baptist
Er as you know Get hy n does work for the Church in Wales now and this in a special way is a testifies to the fact that he is er an e cu men ical person
Working e cu men i call y in Wales
He is also a secretary of En vis that is the commission of covenant to church es of which we are all members of church es
Yes I er I went in February nineteen ninety two and certainly this was a great privilege to be there for was it three weeks
Three weeks I think er spending time with members of other church es and also members of others cultures from all over the world
The er I've got to keep an eye on my watch this is what I'm going by
It's a more than anything else
I know that you are behind schedule and I don't want to incur the w rath of your mode rat or
During the the fortnight in which we met in Can ber ra eight hundred and twenty six of us were official delegates er to the World Council of Church es
Delegates from the member church es
And in a sense the World Council of Church es at this point can be regarded as the supreme leg i sl at ive body of the World Church
And you're quite right er we must regard the World Church as meaning ourselves
We tend to refer to the World Church as something outside our particular constituency and we mustn't forget that we must own the World Church
And this is something that came home to me very much in Can ber ra
We we are from Wales and I would like to say that all the Welsh representatives were at one
That we could own what was going on in Can ber ra
This was not entirely true of other people from other church es in the United Kingdom unfortunately
The World Council of Church es assembly takes pl a place roughly every seven years
And though the World Council Church es was formed before the second world war yet the first assembly was not held until nineteen forty eight at Amsterdam
Second assembly was held in nineteen fifty four at Ed muns ton in the United States
And then it was fir er the turn of the third world the third assembly was held in New Delhi in nineteen sixty one
And then the fourth assembly er was held in Loops a la S w in Sweden and the fifth assembly was er held in Na i rob i
And then er the sixth assembly in Vancouver in nineteen eight three and the seventh assembly in Can ber ra last year
Now you'll see that it has a tendency to go all over the world wherever it is invited but whoever invites the World Council of Church es now must in fact be able to cope with a great number of people
Not only delegates but also people who attend as a service from other church es outside the membership of the World Council and also to cope with the press
Unfortunately in this country we were badly served by the press
And it had it'd be true to say that whatever you read in your newspapers er while we were in Can ber ra I would advise you not to believe half of it
Or a quarter of this
Because what came back to us was very much tit tle t at tle gossip that people picked up in er Can ber ra
And it is true to say that that did not represent the what really went on in Can ber ra
Because above all it was an experience experience of meeting people from different church es wi experience of meeting people of different cultures experience too of listening attentive ly and worshipping with people of different church traditions of your own
And that was something to er an experience to cherish
The World Council Church es on this occasion reviewed the work accomplished during the seven and a half years since the last assembly in Vancouver in Canada
It rec received a report therefore from the Central Council of the World Coun c Council of Church es which meets I think once a year Noel can correct me on this once a year or a at least once every two years
And then we have a member from Wales on the Central Council of the World Council of Church es Miss Carole who er although she is from Wales member of the church of Wales she now lives in Bel fast
But er we were not successful in putting up an er and er to have a member of Wales elected on this occasion to serve for the next seven years unfortunately
And er i it this caused a great deal of hurt if I may say so
And then the er Council also set guidelines for it's programme in the years ahead
It also chose presidents it also chose a hundred and fifty members to serve on the central committee or the executive committee of the World's Council of Church es
It also made statements on pressing issues in the church and the world
And these above all else included the Gulf war because this war was on while we were in Can ber ra
And this really owed a great deal of tension
We er the we we have also to make statements on the indigenous people and land rights because we were confronted with the position of Ab origin e people in er Australia
And we were concerned about their land rights or in other words their human rights
their natural human rights
I'll speak about that in a moment or two
We were concerned too about internal conflicts in certain countries and especially in South Africa
But all these statements revealed the desire of the assembly to pray more ardent ly for the spirit of unity to reconcile people
Indeed this was a very rare opportunity for all delegates and visitors as I said to meet to listen yes and to hear it first hand about the life and witness of more than three hundred member church es throughout the world in a hundred countries
It was certainly and opportunity for the church es together to look at the world situation in conversation together and thus to deep en the faith which have to pro claim at arriving at a common understanding of the situation
It isn't the you are not expected at least I was not expected to to see the Council producing masses of pages for our reading afterwards and this report by the way is worth reading
Sounds of the spirit
If you had read this I shouldn't be here this afternoon
But are we going to inflict that on you
But can I say this that what mattered most to me was the fact that I have been in conversation with so many people and to be able to allow that conversation to affect my faith and a faith that I have to pro claim day by day and Sunday by Sunday from the pulp its of my church
As previous as in previous assemblies worship wasn't central to our activity
Besides morning worship there were mid day sermons and in sessions together with evening worship
What I missed most at this oc ca on this occasion was the opportunity for bible study but I think getting pe era visitor of another kind there was able to visit some of the bible studies each morning
The daily pattern of study and discussion work was divided into two parts in the morning participants met in small groups in the afternoon all members met in session sessions reports from central committee and also er reports on developments in the World Church
The main the me of the assembly therefore was the prayer come holy spirit renew the whole creation
Ap pertaining to a to infuse through dramatic present ic presentation s the main the me by the or ab original of Australian s telling about their life and struggle
Other E cu men ical topics presented were the life and history of e cu men ical movement you retain and justice and peace e cu men ical sharing
and indeed the recent programme justice peace and in te g rat u re of creation featured very prominently in our discussions
And no doubt it will continue as a very important the me for the future
Some them es of the assembly therefore were giver of life sustain your creation spirit of truth set us free spirit of unity reconcile your people Holy Spirit transform and sanctify us
What about the background therefore to the assembly 's discussion
But first of all the global situation in the Gulf
This mar red the peace situation
Plane flights had to be diverted so by the time we got to Can ber ra we were very conscious of the destructive element of the Gulf in our prayers and in our discussions
Secondly we were made aware of the effects of what can be described as liberation thinking and liberation theo log y not only in South America but only also in the Pacific regions Asia Japan and Korea
Then there was the influence of the third world or the two thirds world the church es the politics and the cultures
And then fourth ly more and more the ort hod ox church es placed played a very significant part in guiding the port of as far as as the assembly was concerned
Significantly to there was the abstinence of Roman Catholic church influence and dominance
Some of us some of us tried to make a plea and I hope we will try still try to make a plea that there should be a significant Roman Catholic er element within the membership of the World Council of Church es in the future
So we were presented as it were with a partial membership of the World Church
As far as I'm concerned two things set the assembly in context first ly the sense of space
For many Australian s the desert which covers much of their country means a vast emptiness solitude and the struggle to survive in hostile surroundings
But for the original inhabitant s of the lands the desert is the familiar place that provides nature and gives meaning to life
It was natural therefore that the assembly should take up this kind of understanding
It was not too late to realise that space should be given in the programme for a proper consideration of the perception of winning in relation to the whole team of the assembly
Winning space therefore assumed a significant part of the assembly programme
Again as I said the Gulf war brought the peace question very much into the arena and according ly there was always the pressure for pre ce re consideration of the peace under the general heading of peace space
And can I suggest that we need to bring that very much into our discussions and into our prayers constantly in our church es
Significant that we have been challenged by our master to be peace makers how real is that in our church es
And tomorrow will be the real test won't it not
That we are really praying for peace and identifying ourselves with peace struggle in Ireland
Secondly there was also the context of the Ab origin es
We were reminded of their plight at the opening service of the assembly
One thing I forgot to bring with me this afternoon was a tape of the assembly worship I'm sorry about that but I don't think you've got a tape recorder have you
That upsets me
We were reminded of their plight of peace as I said at the opening service
Outside the marched in the ab origin es had their fire of gum tree branches to purify the atmosphere very much like the flames of fire which appeared on the first whit Sunday
The twenty sixth of January seventeen eighty eight the British established a small prison community at Sydney Cove on the east coast of Australia villain read the declaration and hoist ed the Union Jack claiming the east coast of the entire Australian continent for the British crown
And that meant quite a effect as far as the ab origin es were concerned they had lost their territory
The ab origin es were not consulted or compensated
European occupation of land gradually extended through most of the continent
In more remote areas reserves were set aside for the i gi indigenous ha b inhabitant s
They were sa put aside they did not count
But by the end of the nineteenth century there were six British colonies in Australia
On the first of January nineteen hundred and one they formed a federation and most adult ab origin es were
vote in the process for deciding on the federation
The culture of the minorities of indigenous people that was given providence at the assembly
And this was expressed in a very imaginative presentation by Professor a young in her keynote lecture when she called for three significant changes
The first was that for our generation we must learn how to live with the earth promoting harmony sustain ability and diversity and therefore creation spiritual it y was the keynote of the address
Secondly she said there must be a change from the habit of dual is m to what she described as inter connect i al is m We must see a relationship between things
In many parts of the earth she said the organised life in accordance with a sense of dual is m body spirit man women black and white poor and rich we must try and see them in Christ coming together
They all make sense
The third change was from the culture of death to the culture of life
What is happening right now in the Persian Gulf she says shows the best example of the culture of death
She urged the assembly to use the energy of the Holy Spirit to tear apart all walks of division and culture of death in se para tor s
Let us participate in the Holy Spirit of of life fighting for our life on this earth in solidarity with all living peace
Have you noticed if you listen hard to your radio tomorrow morning and you will hear so much about suffering and death and very little about life
I think we had better try and influence that as church es not that we should about the suffering that goes on about the death that goes on but I think we ought to give all this another dimension in church es
That one would be thankful of the fact that Christ has spoke and talked about life
Now this approach was critic is ed by the Ort hod ox church representatives as merely criticism an attempt to unify different faith s
But many of us saw it as an approach which emphasis ed the need to allow the faith of Christ to be incarnate d within particular culture and Sir Paul the former Archbishop of New Zeal and took the same stand point as a Ma or i in his own address and called delegates present to speak and act as people of hope and to respond sensitive ly to economic and environment pro g ility and isolation not only in the Pacific but wherever they are
Now then who do we assess with the assembly
May I make one or two observations and then I'll finish
On the whole the assembly gave us and understanding of the worldwide church which was struggling to achieve recon c ilia tion and to promote peace and justice
If we belong to the World Church then we must be in with part of this worldwide process and we shall never be ashamed of it
Secondly moreover it was an experience a and an opportunity to meet Christians of other church es
Differ ing traditions and those of other cultures and be in constant dialogue with them
We never have that opportunity in this country do we
Unless we ask people to bring in people for instance from the Afro - Caribbean church es to join us in our worship and to lead our worship
Can I also say that er yes we were badly served by the press but I think that er the on us now is on those of us who went to Can ber ra to be able to share with others and we have been going round to tell others about Can ber ra to share with you and with others the experience of being present in the World Council of Church es in Can ber ra
I would hope that by the time we come to the next assembly where there is going to be that there will be an opportunity for the church es er at home here to take part in preparing for the next assembly
Also that the church es at home of whatever church or de nomination we are to be they also can own not just in the World Council of Church es
At present I do think that there is that kind of willingness to be er engaged in this kind
of preparation
I think we ought to be taking time to try and prepare well for the next assembly and in doing so to own what goes on there and to say yes as the previous speaker said we are the World Church in a very real way
Now mode rat or I've taken yes I'm only five out of
the programme
Er can I say that it's been a great pleasure coming er to you and to say that er m that there's far more to say of course about Can ber ra er but I hope that that taste r will help you to try and appreciate what went on there
Thank you very much indeed
Can I thank you for sharing with us the the example of the concentration that you put so much in such a short time
A good example for the rest of us
We've got the rest
We're grateful for your taking the time to be with us
We're grateful to your commitment to the e cu men ical life of church es in Wales particularly
Last week we met as a team working with and next week we will be meeting
So it'll be Holly well to get it's a good way of
And for your your time and your energy and for your fellowship as well
It's very kind of you all
Thank you
Thank you very much
Yes
You're willing to you're welcome to stay for as long as you wish or to leave when you wish to leave
to us
We ought now to think briefly about
is never to show any interest in anything
because if you do you get landed with what I've got to do this afternoon
And it was my concern that church es should know the implication of the children act as it's related to the life of the church that I'm landing in front of you
You should of all saw the last S y nod papers received this
How many of you are familiar with it
There are a few hands
I've got a red and a blue I'm sorry I haven't got yellow and green
but I couldn't get the political parties
It's not election ee ring er they're just in different colour ed paper to please the eye
Er if you have not had a copy of this sent to you what I have said to them by what I say afterwards er m it will be worth p u r chasing
My question ha again another question how do you make the Lord interesting
Shop per s c rec he that must er registered
What does registration mean
It means that when you go along to the social services register and it's above board children's work that you are doing
But they have a right within the law to carry out to check all persons who are offering help in caring
And registration may be denied anyone who has been convicted of any certain types of offense
It's the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that all those leading groups are people of good standing
The church must make every effort to achieve the highest standards
And the church as bible road to fame in alert ing us to our responsibilities
Now there's one thing that I have to alert us all to the rest may not have been important perhaps only to some of the larger church es but groups are advised and church es are advised to make sure that in buildings that are used ah for many different groups that young children under the age of eight do not come into contact with any casual people who may be using that building
Now that is quite an implication when you think about it
There is need to emphasis e the importance of encouraging people to re receive some sort of training when they come forward and offer to be involved in the work of our under eights and young people
I don't think there's any need for me to spell out any more at this point what that may mean but the responsibility in as church es to ensure that we care for the under eights
I will in fact er m answer any questions afterwards
Thank you N an ette
An introduction that is important
There are a number ar of areas in the ma state legislation that have been aligned to the church or will affect the running of the church
One is the children act one will be something on on on the preparation of food another will be one affecting the way in which charities have to keep registered accounts er financial accounts which means that an example er m is responsible for registering the accounts of congregation s by law
And another will be er m the responsibility to er the minister the alterations to listed buildings which might be landed on the on the church es
What N an ette has said has been an important introduction and if yo if what sa you have prepared altogether is leg ib le then perhaps give it to Eileen and it can go out in the S y nod papers that will be helpful
Er m and in the faith and life department of U RC we'd better preparing a pack on the children rights
Other information on whatever
We move now we move now to er faith and life is on we're on page thirty five
mode rat or and friends of faith and life
In the very short space of time that we have available this afternoon there are three subjects that I need simply to bring to the attention of S y nod
The first the little report under the heading of faith and life on page five of your reports the second is the report of the provincial advocate which is on page six and the third the report of the Youth Secretary which is on page twenty
Er m all those because subjects come under the general umbrella of faith and life and I think er mode rat or probably the correct thing is to do is to be formal and to begin by er proposing that these three reports be received for discussion
Then I'll receive the reports of faith and life and the Youth Secretary and the new secretary for discussion yes
Thank you
Er to take then first the report which you will find on page five you will see that faith and life on this occasion has concentrated on one subject and that is our
weekend that we are arranging this summer as we have done annually for a number of years
Er there is a a little orange leaf let which has been placed on the seats during the day that many of you I hope already have er for anyone who hasn't may I perhaps place these on the front table there's a the there's another supply over there and could I please ask that some responsible representative from each district would please take a few more of these away with you so that they are distributed in district meetings in the near future and attention drawn to them there er if there are not enough copies er then I'm sure the provincial office on receiving a a request from you will make sure there's more that passed on to you
Now if you had an opportunity of glancing at the leaf let already you will have seen that the leader for this July's er weekend is is Mr Henry and I don't think I can do any better than to spend two minutes of the time that we've got in asking Henry if he would say a word or two of introduction to the the me for this year
Ignatius of Loyal er or er more properly known to me in church history was the scourge of the w rath of the of the council of re formation and inside of con sum is m but I think regards some years ago in on Ignatius spiritual it y of bibles which I'm delighted to see John has mentioned in his pro log u e for the er for his introduction to Holy well the the the association 's there came to discover who Saint Ignatius er helping to sort of tap greater spiritual depths and er resources and consequently trained as spiritual director er in I gnat i an things
The spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyal a have once were once described as a sort of a spiritual from which people of past men put together again
Er m that is not the aim of T ra be cc a
Er to start off with they do the full spiritual exercise of Ignatius Loyal all takes thirty days in silent retreat with a with an individual er under individual guidance with a with a a director or it could take anything from nine months to eighteen months to do in er day da da da living in open sort of retreat
What I hope to do is simply to share with you the life of Id i go and in experiences and to walk alongside him and also to help us reflective ly to look and examine our own journey where are we with God
Where's God in our life where has he been and where is he directing us
And so it'll be a gentle I hope and er reflective type of weekend and er using some of the tools of Ignatius and other tools cos Ignatius was very er adaptable er you know in in methods of prayer and reflection and con temp la tion
I
Thank you
And I I I hope that I I hope there's a good variety of people will again as you always have done will turn up er this year to share fellowship a on this the me which er is is a refresh the me I think for for many of us
Now the other two subjects I'm really only dealing because the people responsible are are not here in the flesh this afternoon but A ly d the provincial advocate and I I think of Bill that's also gone too er yes he he has he has had to leave this afternoon
Er m so what I promised to do in er era moment or two if people are to ask specific questions or comments to make arising from either of those printed reports on page six and page twenty er m if you would make your point or ask your question now er it will be recorded and transmitted to the officers responsible and they will take any necessary action or give any rev erent replies to those questions
This doesn't pre c lu de any private questions in conversation with those people at any stage during the life of the church
So if if there are any formal concerns that anybody would wish to bring formally before S y nod and er m to either A ly d or Bill then perhaps state them
Right
Right yes I shall happy to convey to the mode rat or that S y nod was er totally satisfied with the reports that are here before me and give them one hundred percent support in the work
Thank you
Bill is is er m with the group of young people who are having a weekend in
Er those were the people that walked in and walked out
We come now to the final committee report which is on page thirteen of the page thirteen

High notes
Very good
Well I must admit I'm gonna have to present a finance report which is received by an over tu re
And first of all before we er we put the reports we there are a number of er there's one alteration and a number of er additions obviously alteration or I should say a a an amendment is something an important place on page fifteen er at the to pe of the page referring to December nineteen ninety two I've put which is agreed by G P committee with the exception of young these representatives that we ask them to bring thirty pounds towards the cost that should be twenty five
That's the actual figure
Er m one difficulty with with giving a financial report is so many things seem to happen quickly and a er m apart from the fact that there was a a major finance resources comes from we as well you see that I have to tell you now these have been done on the red letter assembly side and you may want to alter one there er according to reform I see the cost per er m person attending is not a hundred and twelve pounds but a hundred and fourteen pounds and that means that we have forty representatives we've got to try and find four thousand five hundred and sixty
Now I hope I've got these facts right and I'm sure that not that Eileen may correct me that er we have er forty hundred pounds in the budget budget for this er the er m South Wales congregation has has kindly er m given us grant of a thousand pounds and I understand from the secretary of con Cardiff congregation and he's also offered a thousand pounds I don't know whether we've got that yet
But then
That will be it is thousand so that's er that's three thousand four hundred short of a four by sixty
And what the difference is that er we thought that you could have one young person per district and that they only have to pay thirty two pounds each but I think these are only purely
Yes er I have them for those who received that in correct information from me I must apolog ise er m young people who are going as delegates as representatives of their district must be treated as adult representatives and they have to pay full price
Er for for people who are going to group and and for any young people who are going observers there are special arrangements to be made which doesn't relate to our official represented district I'm sorry about that
So that means that erin th the total we do have to pay in some way or another is four thousand pounds with sixty but we'll say we've already got three thousand four hundred if all the for forty people go and they pay twenty five pounds each that's another thousand so we've got a I think I've got it right a we're only a hundred and sixty short
Fairly reasonable
I hope we get that from somewhere
So er er that that is if we're up - t o - d a t e on the financial
Now the most er serious business the er Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety two and the Ministry of Mission Fund nineteen ninety three
At the meeting er of the Financial Resources Committee that I attended on Wednesday the first thing we discussed was the er the giving so far up to the end of February from the various province s and we by the end of February er the total was up to thirty thousand pounds less than we required er which could mean that the end of the year it could be a hundred and eighty thousand pounds less than required but er of all the
all the province s bar one have balances which could be used to make that up so the money is fairly short and we're bear er for pains the
ten and a half thousand from the first of July on wards for this year
Now er m i i in Wales and I'm sorry to say our figure er we should of produced ninety thousand pounds and we pro vi er produced er eighty three thousand two hundred and nine that means we are er six thousand eight hundred down in two months
Now we have a balance as it already tells you erin er earlier in the paragraph of this paper that that we had a er balance of sixteen thousand pounds a in the ministry last year so if we knock sixteen thousand pounds
what we're likely to be short of it seems to me we could end up being twenty four thousand pounds short at the end of the year
Now there are quite a number of reasons for this and the good news I think that I bought good news again this morning is that presentation s both about bud gets er and about what we do wi with the small church es is er could be some of our salvation
Question of bud gets our I was almost said halle lu ja
If only all our church es could do that we would really be getting somewhere
The biggest problem of all is that we can't look forward and that a lot of the problems being problems are happening now and happened since the er the first of January that should of happened they should of happened in th in th in the er at least the three months before the end of last year if not more
So er we're getting people saying it's impossible to pay this even though they were asked if they could pay it at the the the time it was given sometime last July
Well that's one the other reason of course we have got a large number of c hur very small church es in fact looking at our mai ministry figures nineteen ninety there were thirty church es that didn't pay anything to the maintenance and a lot of these I think maybe
that both Geth w y n and Russell sorted out er who up on on those extremes that you get in a group that that maybe feel they re that they really have nothing to hardly anything to do with us they've don't receive ministry and why should that be and after be asked each year has to go up
And they see o I just wonder whether they just pile letters in the wastepaper basket
And therefore if it can really come to this possibility of ministry a sort of Young Farmers Club idea of getting themselves about that could be a a a a a a marvellous boost
So the the other thing which is er er ma real problem partly because of that is is when one talks about an increase in in giving increase in percentage i or a contribution of the church is in er we were talking about twenty percent la twenty one percent last year that would be alright if everybody gave twenty one percent
Those who did nothing they can eas easily increase their giving by twenty one percent it's still the same
It means that the other people have to give more that's why some of the church es I think they've found that their er requests for their er er their er contributions have gone up enormously
So er those are the pro those are a lot of the problems that we are we are facing now will we really er will we end up at twenty four thousand down at the end of the year
That i all I can say is that my that's my best guess at the moment
We know there are some church es which er will probably only pay quarter ly so they haven't paid yet so that's money that's coming in
On the other hand we know there are some church es that are finding great difficulty in meeting er what they've said they can
and are doing their best to do it
So that's on the down side
So er at the moment they're saying all I can see is that er we would have to use up the whole of our balance that's sixteen thousand and the twenty four thousand ar r ears
Now that as the picture er leads me on to the next er stage which is what in ministry er what can we do in nineteen ninety three
Er m a letter was sent to all district secretaries who I think in mo most cases sent these round to church es to see if we could get some idea from you as to what sort of increase in contributions could be possible for nineteen ninety three
That's quite difficult to do because where there's so many church es not being sure whether they're going to make it this year how can they say what's going to happen next year
On the other hand er if we did what our friend from Che l ten ham is doing we would have lo we would be looking forward like that all the time we would have some idea
Now I'm pleased to say we have had quite a number of of er replies from church es on what they think they can d do
On the other handsome of these er are good re positive replies and some of them some are negative
And it seemed to me that when I as the er your representative on Provincial Finance Committee is asked to make a co commitment for this for this for er for nineteen ninety three I could say no better than what we had as out target this year and that was hard
Cos clearly we've only er reached something like five hundred three thousand four thousand er then it's gonna be a a big jump to get to the five hundred and forty
Now nobody er era at this stage at the er Financial Resources Committee er challenge us on this figure I think we will just stage of of doing ari th arithmetic of adding it up but no doubt that the staff will be comparing what going to beer what within a but have prepared for next year with what we're supposed to do this year and ours is an increase of another percent
We look at all the other conferences the lowest after that was the Northern Proven ce which is in a very similar position to ourselves and they were offering a five percent increase
Era few others were offering seven to nine and most of the others were offering between ten and fifteen percent
So we're way down on all the others so that then falls three hundred thousand pound short of what is required to er give ministers an increase to twelve thousand next year
There seem to be our two groups erin one of our province s and they say that the rich and poor but the rich er er are not so rich and others
That in fact er there are three province s who are already now contributing more than anyone else that they feel that the church es should go forward to try and raise the minister 's to what was proposed ly that the assembly last year they should be paid thirteen thousand two hundred but in order to do that see another six hundred thousand pound raised and it is likely that this will be put as a challenge to the church es at assembly
Now if I could just remind you of what's happened at the Ly n d ford Haven er er S y nod last March er m the Financial Committee have suggested that we should go for a target of five hundred and ten thousand but er this is we are not gonna be able to even start looking at the eleven and a half thousand if if er all the province s do it for months and more and we I think very bravely or foolishly whatever way you li look at it proposed that we should got to five hundred and forty thousand and it looks as thought we're gonna end up certainly nearer to five ten than five forty
Er m but if we er are are going to en ensure that ministers can get er at least twelve a of twelve thousand next year then we have to er er m there has to be further offers from province s
As I say there are three province s who'd like to go further and than that be even er more increases
Now I have put down reports about the finance committee er as it were but I think the response s from the church es and districts sort of cal cu la tor will be there we think that it would seem as though we should only offer the same amount as last year
But I think if we have further discussions with church es and districts that we might see that we can break that a bit further for that reason when we come to er come to the resolution s I would advise you er er propose a minor amendment with the second thing
But I think that er
We can now receive this report for the
Any questions or comments on paragraph s that are not er m relating to those
So any questions or comments on paragraph one on page thirteen
Or paragraph two or paragraph three or paragraph five or paragraph that's it
Yes
So if there are no questions or comments on those paragraph s er m we move to the other resolution s
be amended
I think so yes
Yes
Er what I would like to propose the er m a a that resolution two of course was put down at the time it had to be put down er and is clearly going to be affected by that it happened at the th the financial services in March and what I have suggested is that you might prefer this be a a a second resolution it is or and turn to the to add on the end of that resolution thus urging local church es to through their consultation s with district treasurer s and finance committee to increase their contributions to the Ministry of Mission Fund in nineteen ninety three in such a way that provincial comm i commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two
But th the thing is that it looks as though it is going to be a fairly ongoing thing that's going to it may be well on certainly er a beyond assembly when we have to come to a conclusion and therefore we ought to know the picture er of within reform church es far more clearly in giving more time
But clearly we need to have the authority that the that er to having discussed to a form of
And If I understand this now
Mm
er we have a choice the resolution before us endorse the action taken by the provincial treasurer in the level of commitment he has made to the MM F fund in nineteen ninety three on behalf of the
And that commitment which Alan has made I'm right Alan
Yes
Is a nought percent increase
It's nought percent
over our commitment
Er m would you like to take that resolution first and make this a sort of a an extra resolution
Right okay then
I think that will be that will be clearer
First of all if we debate now whether or not the S y nod endorses the action taken by judicial mode rat or
Treasurer
in the level of commitment he has made to the MM F fund of nineteen ninety three on behalf of the proven ce and we now know that that's a commitment was a commitment of a nought percent increase
We'll debate that first
It's gotta be done first
Mm
David
Can I just clarify
Stand up please
David can I just clarify that this resolution now supersedes what is said in the report
No er we're proposing that we just do take this re so in other words if you endorse the fact that I say I I sa committed the
But what do you say about
Yes
the ones you've written down
Yeahthat's right yes
The because this report has been written
three or four weeks ago before Alan was able to vet all the information
And in view of the information he had when he went to London for a meeting last Wednesday and that was when he consulted with other people deciding that he should offer a nought percent increase
Okay
So that's right
Er m one can then

perhaps cure the provincial credit brought to us
And following that recommendation we accepted a rash amendment on the floor of
Increasing the commitment with the treasurer and not to be rash with it but the people understand people who are mostly killed in church es and and either way should not pass to am end a resolution for the Council
You're not with it
at the er the ministry but maybe the ministry er will be
Could we not have er I think procedure is could we not have the er er resolution for the at first and now that a ministry is in motion
Er m I think we need to endorse the action taken by the judicial treasurer and then if we was then to go on to second bits which is urging the church es to give five percent more than that in the past you could debate that se separately
Investigative procedure will follow and we keep the two things clear we're making the the treasurer is er m suggesting that this proven ce of the U RC makes no makes not to increase
There's no to increase over this year 's commitment
That's what we've proposed
Er Bob
I've got a question on
Bob
does that mean that the assessment for each church will remain the same for a couple of years
Is that the er is that the implication
Er m
But does it still need somehow
No I can't
or other if the assessment will increase
It will vary because er er m er we we ac remember that we have a formula which will expose to what your er er m nominated in come was in previous years what the membership you know these have all changed so it could be i I wouldn't like to say it's exactly the same could be a bit of a problem
But also there you can ministers because minis er church es they count for more than two years stop being central funds and therefore if we had too many
church es that entered
a third year of vacancy next year that puts
more of a burden on church es with ministers
Mm
So i i it just depends on
Thank you
May I ask one more thing
By by very special
Oh

Er m in order to meet a commitment which is the same as this year commitment then last here increasing last year because this year's commitment we will not reach this year therefore we'll be into deficit
Therefore to pay that commitment again the church es must be asked to give more and ask the treasurer to make a further commitment and the church es must find more again
So it can't be the same as in church es even if it stays in the profit
Any other comments
Keep them coming
to say from what we
Right
Cos I don't mind taking this action er mI think the the thought is that I would like to propose that we have a word with the government
Because I think that they and that we can only say the same again next year when our own everything goes up and I think it's very sad that the church can't
Is that a formal amendment
Yes it is
Is there a second er to that formal amendment
Does anybody want to speak for that amendment s now
That we add the words with sadness to the resolution
Could I say also with sadness that in that that yes things are going up but one thing isn't going up and tha that's our membership
Yes
Mm
And that is as one of the members of we have a I think we can afford to have member on the finance of church es who are called at the assembly of the U RC who er
Good yes
in fac term anybody that says a lot of sensible things and says look if people are asked to er to er increase their giving by nought percent that me it probably means the church might have to be
cos the membership has gone down
Mm mm
Thanks
Mm mm
The amendment to add the word with sadness to this resolution number two on page sixteen is before you those in support of the amendment that we add the words with sadness to the resolution please show
And those against the amendment please show
The amendment is carried
So the resolution before us now is that the S y nod endorses english grammar writing
S y nod endorses with sadness the action taken by the provincial treasurer in the level of commitment s he has made to MM F in nineteen ninety three
We'll be making that resolution
If there are no other further comments or questions set before you would you show if you're in favour of resolution two of page sixteen
In favour
Those against
We now move to the er m sort of two A which I will now as and this will be that S y nod urges local church es through their consultation s with district treasurer s and the finance committee to in c r us increase their contribution to MM F in nineteen ninety three in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two bud gets targets sorry
Targets
I'll read it again that we that S y nod urges local congregation s through their consultation s with district treasurer s and finance committee to increase their contributions to MM F in nineteen ninety three in such a way that the provincial commitment may be increased by fi by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two targets
If anybody would like to speak
Could I just say a
Yes
I think I should while you're putting the words in such a way so it wasn't a er it wasn't thought that everybody just increased everything by five percent
But as I say the the people who did not five five percent er therefore others may not have given more
Others may give less because they've got a lot of members so that therefore it's so that the proven ce as a whole could be advised
And I would have thought us giving five percent and and there are other province s that are giving more will ensure at least the the on twelve thousand we pay next year and therefore starting with eleven and half thousand we paid this year and that province s and in ourselves went further than that it is possible
Not very good
Surely John er mat home would like today off fishing

How much longer mode rat or can we in the Welsh proven ce accept being the poor relationship within the de nomination s
Indeed how much longer can we expect the other province s to continue carrying us
We are no poorer than some of the
Mm
noble province s
No
Because we hear great er m shouts cack u la tions of joy from those province s that can afford to increase their giving shouldn't allow us to sit on our morals
I think it's a great tragedy that Wales considers itself to be the poor relation within the United Reform Church and the answer can only lie within Wales
I can't come en elsewhere we have to support this motion too
Any other comments
The motion is before that S y nod urges local church es through their consultation s with district treasurer s and the finance committee to increase their contribution to MM F in nineteen ninety three in such a way that th that the provincial commitment may be increased by at least five percent over the nineteen ninety two targets
For those in favour please show
And those against please show
And that's carried
So we move to resolution three on page sixteen
I think er m er I know there has been some discussion of I I about er and I put erin this report I think all the documentation that the ministers and ministers that had already seen it and I've explained that the big issue is that er the U RC I think a weekly account o ah of all other information s has er worked out very on the basis of five thousand and I was been tugging you pay your car off to get that and
The church in Wales er and and from a a survey of one church in Church of England in He mel He mps tea dI discovered that their rate seemed to be about thirty two P per mile
You've got to work it out on the basis of ten miles not on the basis of five miles
I think also er and this er it may be that the er er U RC does not want to be pushed round er we got up er to how many ministers this applies but I do know there are quite a number of ministers which who need their own cars a and a a at the church that pays the er insurance the road license and even something for the maintenance
Now clearly if you were paid say six hundred pounds for that and you only did twelve hundred miles you're getting fifty P a mile anyway
And they've got I think the odds are that people are giving more perhaps er and that er if they were paid at fifty four P per mile and and got how that would affect the church es er contributions they make
And therefore er our proposal is that we should adopt the figures at the bottom of the page which are actually those which the the er erIn land Revenue have recognised in ones where you don't have to er put in a tax return for for
So resolution three is before you for discussion
Peter
I know I'm a
Reading for our I mean er I supply my own car my church has recognised that whether I'm probably if I pay the tax and the insurance er m and I just thirty two thirty five that's but when I'm in business or I'm in province s and I'm allowed to pay what ten fifteen
Fifteen
pence a mile
Fifteen
And I do not
or be sub sid is ed you know a a I mean I think that's consistency
Well I I shall leave you to go through the questions for a few minutes
from from er m I'm rather concerned about what the er proven ce here is intending to do
Er m I've worked for ten and a half years within this county of Cl w y d as a social worker regarded as an extension al and every year my employers er who are based in London would like the county to know what were the rem ec recommended mileage rates for the re im bur s el to a business car mileage
Now if Cl w y d or G w y ned d or any other county for that matter within Wales or in England er decided that in themselves that they would not implement the national recommendation er then there duly would be all hell to pay and rightly so
And certainly now that of course ministers don't have a union unfortunately
Er
No
they would allow me half now er m I've been looking at one particular church one de nomination er which is the Methodist Church although it has been said already here this afternoon or this morning rather there are an overall er m joint style with Methodist and with United Reform Church and er m I have personally the Methodist of last year last September where it gives and also er m mileage recommendations
I'll be viewing the Methodist Church in quite a different way but I think it's very important for us to be made aware of how they do it er m for example if you have er m a a or or and I don't think any church has are provided within that and gets a like
In addition to that you get depreciation of one thousand one hundred and forty four pound per year which by my reckoning is ninety five pound a month in addition to that as a Methodist Minister you get a standing charge of five hundred and twenty eight pound per year which is forty four pound pe er per month and then you also through i in the year if you have a major repair needed on your car you get a hundred and eight pound now if in fact I had I have a V aux hall Nova and let me take these figures as you are at twenty four P a mile or twenty four point five P a mile and if that's all we are recommended recommending in other words there's no lump sum at all er that would mean that I would be getting forty nine pound but Methodist this colleague in Ll an dud no if he did
Perhaps I shouldn't do this yet cos we haven't agreed it
But we have a new secretary
Er if you agree it an and report
And I'm gonna ask Catherine to stand up so that you can all see who she is
We're involved in bringing things together we're involved lots of things and
At the back in black
there are lots of things
At the back in black
committee if you go downstairs you will see on the notice there a display of various things that we do and on the windows ill s there are various pieces of information free sheets that you can pick up and take away it will tell you about all sorts of issues
The way in which society imposes an agenda on us asks us questions in the church es
I think we're not too bad in doing that
But what we need to do as well is to listen wha to what the church es are saying as they address these issues
And I want to er m ask you please if you have any comments about the work of The Old Church and Society Committee the work we do fo fo for S y nod and in the proven ce please make those comments known to Catherine or to your district representative
We need to hear from the local church es from the district councils what's going on wha what the issues that concern you are so let's as well the ones that you see downstairs we may already be addressing so have a look down there have a look at the the information but if there are any issues you feel we ought to be addressing then please let us know so that we can put them on our agenda
That's all I want to say except to er who that S y nod received the report of the Church and Society committee
I'm assuming you've read that report
Have you received it
Yeah
Yes
Does anybody wish to make any comments or ask any questions about this particular section
Don't think that's a lack of interest I think it's matter of discipline
Oh Good
Okay then
Thank you Peter and thank you Catherine er m we will give the view in due course
We move to the D P committee report which is on page seventeen
I'm gonna go very speedily and ask that we receive this report for debate
Good
Yes
Any comments on any section that is not pertaining to the resolution that was on page nineteen
Er m one from Mike Mike
and is that I always feel threatened or paranoid I just want to make a point on on paragraph seven the rule in which to review the is that my understanding that review will be about the role and of the rule in which the
We will note that in a minute
Right
Er
I just wanna refer to item one which is to do with the S y nod
That's actually a different resolution
Is it
So we come back to that
Well
Do you w ann it
A hah
Right I would say
Sorry
Sorry
Any other comments about any other questions not pertaining to the resolution there
We therefore come to resolution two in which to make it to paragraph one
You're so gracious John
So it's just simply to er comment about the the future work that's gonna be done by Gl an mole er the work of investigation as I understand it at the end of that first section
Really two things brought up investigation to consider the first is with trusts the very important piece of work that's done by trusts on behalf of the proven ce another proven ce may or may not know that there are the trusts have now been er between trusts er m South Wales trusts er m
Mon mouths hire
North Wales trust and Mon mouths hire have now all been amalgamated into one and we're working through the implications of that
And we have had the trust secretary who has been working on our behalf voluntarily for some time now
I don't think anybody appreciates just how much and I would like to put it on record how much George does on behalf of the proven ce a very considerable piece of work
If you were part of the trust meetings and saw the degree of work that he does do regularly on our behalf it is quite considerable he doesn't do it for nothing
I can't imagine that George is gonna continuing doing that forever and it may well be that we'll be faced with a possibility of of what we do in the future to have that piece of administration done will we be able to assume that it could done voluntary in the future
Or will it be part of the administrative task of the church
So I'dI'd like that to be er considered er when this whole investigation is carried on
And the second point too is to say is to ask at least to consider whether then in some centre s the work of the S y nod ought to be trimmed down to match the particular work that is being done
I mean tha is it all you know do we need all the time to have er m extra administrative help and in in and in terms of which we've been talking about before I know they might sound like two conflicting issues but one of the ways of en su ring we get the work done is do we trying too much at the S y nod
Should we be thrust ing more work down to districts and th and they'll to do the job rather than always assume it should be done at this level
I think I'm not going to encourage debate on that I think we've heard what Kenneth said particularly about the trusts the working done by the trust and would suggest that we ask Granville to take that on board as well and be within the presentation s too
And I think some would be the less about the too much work perhaps being done by S y nod and not enough by districts
I think it is something that we should encourage church es to talk about the districts to talk about speaking of the district secretary I
But there we are I I think we'll just take that on board like that
Er m resolution that S y nod appoint s Jo John as S y nod clerk for a period of up to three years to commence at a date mutually convenient to him and the present S y nod clerk
Those in favour of that resolution
Any against
Right
I think er m we are not going to say thank you to Eileen now because she is not finishing as S y nod clerk and that's a conscious decision
It may be that er Eileen will be S y nod clerk this time next year as well we don't know
S y nod will di vu l ge a degree of f lex no quite seriously a degree of flexibility and we're grateful both to Eileen and er to John for allowing that degree of flexibility to take place
And S y nod will of course will be informed er
when when S y nod clerk has changed
But we're grateful to Eileen for what she is doing and will continue to do and we're grateful to John for what he intends to do er m for three years at any stage wha at any stage in which they choose
thank you
Then resolution three that S y nod appoint s the Reverend David Henry and N an ette as the rep as representatives on the Mission Council and this pertaining to paragraph two
First ly I think I should say that straight away one hopes that these three er m and that's regrettable
But the background is that of fifty letters were sent out to a variety of people er lay and ordained whatever that means
Er m asking for permission to put their names forward and from the the few letters we had the this was that we thought was the whites t knights in terms of Geography in terms of sex in terms of I wouldn't say intelligence perhaps I should try to impress them
Er m are there any comments or questions
Those those supporting that please show
Against
Er m now this present report is no longer necessary er m because paragraph three is now no longer accurate er m because a change that took place in the General Assembly Executive Committee last the week before last
My feeling is that it wouldn't have when there's a been a change perhaps there could be no from the
the secretary and as semi - e x e c u t i v e now does not apply to this I would suggest that somebody un constitution ally intervene s the S y nod advocate and ignore this resolution and continue with the second Saturday of March and the second Saturday in April
Can you agree
Yo
Yes
Agreed
Yes
Does S y nod accept the nomination s in section ten
These nomination s are do clearly written
Yesif we could make a comment please the thing about in July
Yes
Could it be looked at
Well it's er m and the see if you could another appointment er m for when he has got
That's okay
Those in agreement with resolution five please show
And when we come to resolution six er there is only one district council which has a made a nomination for the er m mode rat or for general assembly for ninety three ninety four
And that was Mid - W a l e s district council
You will all find yellow sheets of paper if wondering why we're reading about the
Mid - W a l e s district council er m I think unanimous ly wish to put this nomination of revere n ce in the past er m and the nomination for mode rat or of general assembly from ninety three to ninety four
They have read it was proposed and second ed by the Reverend s er m Mike and Geth w y n and if there any questions I am sure that they are to answer questions rather than ask them to speak to us
thank you
There was quite a lot of discussion in the Mid - W a l e s District Council about this nomination er m it wasn't that reminds me yes it was
all members votes voted in favour of it
Er m so it had been thought about quite seriously
Is S y nod willing to take this for the general assembly as a nomination for er m if she agrees to nomination for mode rat or general assembly
Yeah
Could I could I just ask what particular element she has for Wales to nominate why why why was Wales nominated
Any you know particular reason for that having got David here ah I I I've decided to go through actually
But how
But I I of course felt the of giving me something that he would be known by everybody in Wales
Er a and therefore I would of thought that was a everyone but I'm just wondering why it is that now what of Wales
Are there any other questions to refer to district council
No
Can you answer
Well I felt one of two ways first ly when we're looking for a mode rat or of the U RC we're looking for a mode rat or for the whole church
And secondly in terms of Liz Liz is someone I know extremely well and have worked with in various functions and committees over the past
We have someone always there for those who have er society those who are poor er women er many of the issues that we feel very strongly and here here She had no sort of cultural historic resonance with the nation of Wales but I'm sure her and the way she approaches her whole ministry would mean that she'd have a lot of than those of us here in the U RC in Wales
The resolution is comes before you from Mid - W a l e s district council those in favour of sending er Elizabeth 's nomination forward if she agrees to that please show
Those against
That is carried
We've come I think to the end of our business which is good
You will have tea at half past four which is which is er splendid
There are a couple of things I would like to say one is that you will find people have asked regards the paper which David mentioned in Northern Ireland that has been distributed it was pinned to another sheet of paper er m headed The Last Attempt and there are more copies available it's simply to know where to find that
We must have three minutes of relax at i on before beginning S y nod
Before beginning
Thank you for before yo before you start the please please we haven't quite finished
Before we actually have that three minute break er mI think we should formally thank the Church of England of Holy well for its hospitality laid down

There is quite a lot on at the moment cos I've got a church meeting this evening at Flint about er ministry

One is very very weak
It was er I think I'll try a bit of your cake if I may
Yes i take it at your peril I'm afraid
Well if I get home safely I'll be alright
But the other th r three are a reasonable size are they
Er m well Salisbury Park's got sixty odd members er m K even m our twenty odd W re er so Johns town ooh a dozen or fifteen something like that and there's a se and the fourth one Ba real a he's down to next to nothing
So er
In fact we're wondering whether it's going to be possible to keep it up but the trouble is it's in an are a where in the last ooh over over recent years forty chapel s have closed
Really
And we sort of don't want that to be the forty first
No
No
Gosh
It's and it's quite near the B rum rose steel works which means of course there's a lot of unemployment there closed
Mm
There are there is this a a rural are a on the whole or that so many have closed chapel s
Er well it there's you see we've got W rex ham is a good sized town
M hm mm
Er m and from W rex ham down to Cher k is sort of almost an urban development
M hm
That as soon as you get a a bit to the west country
Oh
And that's the are a where the chapel s have closed
Well no you see er m across where actually Songs of Praise is coming from this evening
Mm
is a is a place where ooh there there used to be any number of Welsh chapel s
Mm
that I er now well there's hardly any now
Really
Yeah
Excuse me a sec I just want to I was just letting the water er the radiator was a little bit

Excuse me

I've got
Cos I'm gonna ask her to er m speak about the
I think it might be
Herbert's in the way
Yes alright I'll move now
I've got her address whether I've got her phone number
I don't know whether I've got her phone number
I'll I'll I'll see if I've got it then
Yes
Yes
Well
I don't know whether you can get out yet
I think
I've I
Herbert's blocking
I
everybody in
I had to park at The Three Pigeons I couldn't get in
Oh
If you remember the
Yes yes and I
Oh you won't need sixteen mega bytes even if you decide to improve the let's unpack that thing and then we'll see how much space we're talking about how much of that's padding and how of that is real thing
I was taught that when I worked in the grocery warehouse
If you open a box with a pen knife always do that
So that you have to
So get it to go all the way
Cut the end that's for
Do the contents the world of good
Mm
Oh
What's happened to this
Yeah
Yep get it out
Whatever
Right we're on to this roll now
Oh
Right
Right
Can you pull that off
That one
Right
Before I realised I've got mine
Okay
It is slightly bigger than the other one isn't it
Quite a lot bigger actually
Mm
Oh dear
Yesit's got more back to it
Oh the screen mm about the same size
It's a little bit bigger I think you'll find if you put the tape measure on it you'll find it's a little bit bigger
Right
Right
Presumably this is the power supply for it
Yeah
W oops
The main colour monitor operating instructions in here
How many spare points you got
Er m one at the moment but I can pull out the radio without any problem
Oh fine
It's a
Noone of these s pools
Full wear
If I can crawl under here I
Yes I just wanna have a look at yes you can crawl under there to your hearts content
You can unplug that for the moment
I'm not really worried about it
No I just thinking it's easier if I take it down this way
Oh alright
Then I pull it
Now
Ultimately er they might change the lead on the end of that monitor
What's the matter
I was wondering where the socket is
Oh I see where it's gone
Right
I should have
Oh there's plenty of wire
Oh yes
Right
Now if I'd have been sensible
Yes
which I really am I'd have brought over my
Oh
what's his name
My monitor
Why
Well if I'd swapped monitors with you can pro and I don't suppose you'll wanna get rid of your A ms t r ad today
No
and you'll probably want to keep it for a little while
Yes
Oh hang on moving leads and things don't stand up
Not just yet anyway
Right
Er m I could of taken the black and white one
Mm
and then I could have shown mine to this lady cos I mean the only difference is is the black and white isn't it
Er yes
Er I'll have another lead for you in just a sec I'm afraid
Hang on a mo just screw this in
Right straight under there there is actually a power out point on this so if we can get the right kind of plug
Yes
we could actually drive the monitor off the box and you'd only need one socket
Well it doesn't really matter because I got and un used socket here
Yeah but I mean if you i in some ways it's easier cos then when you turn it off you turn everything off
You see what I mean
Yes
Er er m there's a white plug have a seen a muck y grey a white plug
I'll lower it down here
I've got yes
Got it
Yes
Fine
It's here
Right it's in
That's in
We need the keyboard now
I got a er find out where that plugs in
At the back somewhere usually
Then we can turn it on and see if it all works
Can you hold that for a mo
While
Yes
I hold the lead
Yes
There's a Oh
That's got the vacuum on the top
Ah
Anything down that hole
Have you found it
Aha
Oh
Just seeing
it's twelve I didn't realise that went in there
No and somewhere or other I have got for you a copy of the long string the long you know
The er m the long trip card to work gently
Oh I see
Right there you go
Have you got a ruler
Yes
Yes that's fine
Yes you see that screen's twelve inches and that's screen's over over an inch bigger nearly fourteen
Mm
Do you want to turn it on
Is that the on button
Aha
It's just rock it
Don't push it properly
Oh good it's the go it's the good DO S
Yeah
It's a good do that's a very good er m files
Oh
put out
Mm
Oh that's interesting
Let's have a look
Has it got a DO S directory
Two DO S director i es
Old Do DO S and old DO S
I got version five
Well that's the latest isn't it
Yeah except I haven't got all the things
Well if it's on this hard disc could we copy it over
We could we could we could keep it
An E
Cos it's
I R C and that's that's like oh no we can have it it's all set up this will save us a ag ages of time
Good
DO S
Goodness a lot of files on there
It would of been better
If you'd done a P
No sub - d i r e c t o r y slash P Oh marvellous
I think we'll call it that
Let's ring
Er m how do we get it to load high that's what I want to know
Mm
just er m
er m
I haven't got his work number on the memory so I'll
Right
have to look it up
Er I should know it but
No handbook but I suppose we can buy some DO S five hand books
Well I was thinking that
It would be worth copying all that off
Yes
Before we lose any of it
Er perhaps it's not
I know work
I wonder if we'll get him
Ah well if not we'll try the car
No
Oh right

this one goes straight through to his office doesn't it
Ya
Good morning
How are you
Ooh fine thanks
We just want a bit of information about setting up a computer
Da er David 'll talk to you
Hiya Rob
Er m these things have come with DO S five on them er but no books or anything
But never mind
Er m in the ah or to accept dot that no con fig si how do you get it to load high
Have you got a pencil and paper
Er
Oh right
I'll get you some
I mean you got I mean I've got the rest con fig s y s sorted out
Will do
Aha
Yes
I mean I've put files equals twenty yeah but I'm DO S equals high with a H I G H yes
Right
That's all I really needed to know
I don't need much else
Apart from busy sitting there thinking er m yeah well I usually leave command dot com in the root directory
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
It should give yeah I just need country yeah
Do does it help if DO S is high is near the beginning
Oh well it doesn't matter
Fine that's alright
I'll just add it to the end that's all I was thinking
Sometimes the they make a fuss if you put them in the wrong place
No not at the moment
Yeah
Yeah ultimately they might wanna end up with er m a mouse driver high but it's alright
Yes I mean it does it for you doesn't it
Basically
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
I used to always load anti s y s but I then I found out there's nothing I ever I really needed it so I took it out
But I suppose you've got more complicated set ups than me
What
Yeah
Mm
Okay thanks very much Rob
Bye Yesright
Now let's find out something
Just check that that boots properly
Control al t it's deleted segment but we don't really need that
We'll let it just setup isn't really that e er m you can do fancy things
Er that's a I think what we'll do is we'll get used to it
Mm
So I'll just put that there
Would you be turning that round there
I can do that sometimes but I don't
Er m no soon as you get an ordinary chip dot bat file
Mm
er m it will it reads the clock automatically
We'll just have to set it once but it hasn't done it
It's no good setting now because if there's no al t dot bat
I it won't keep it
Yeah
Mm mm
Oh
Right
Er I need a copy of X tree
Er
I want to have a look at the
Er mmy is
I'm always carrying it
Here it is
I'm always sorting out people's computers for them
Ah
I said I always carry X tree I'm always sorting out people's computers for them
I see
A chair would help wouldn't it
Yes why not have one
Er would you prefer the chair or the stool
Have what you like
It doesn't matter one can have one
Ah interesting
Aha
I wonder what's in old DO S
Read me now
View
Oh I understand
That's fine you can delete that
Aha
That's fine
Now then er I wanna get back on to your computer
Right
Cos I want to that you need to put somewhere safe that's the disc driver for the card
Oh
This is a
So that's backup is it
Yeah write protected if you wouldn't mind
Oh
Before you get anywhere else done
Er m
Right
M hm
Right
Where did I where did I put that piece of paper I had
Here you are
DO S equals high that's high
Drive five one one that's There we are
Right
Ooh
Take the X tree out there what's that's
Oh that's funny
What's that
It goes the other way
That'll take a bit of getting used to that
How do you mean it goes the other way
You turn it it's on the other side
Feels funny
Oh it's done
Do anything different you still turn it the same way to lock it down it's just
Oh it's just the shape of the thing
Just feels different
You can get used
Mm
to it quick enough
Er and that one and that one how's that one
Er control copy all eight files as they are to the and that should do it say on there
Actually
Doesn't take long does it
No
Right
Let's have a look look see
There are
That's assist what's this
Six
How do you get in this one
In there oh you don't
Yeah this is a windows thing
You don't need it
Lovely
Oh that
Here
Win eight twenty is
Yeah so if you'd have been running windows on it
I'll check it
Files read only
Oh well it doesn't matter
Oh
I wouldn't worry
Okay
Oh by the way you'll only have one det well it you've got the whole lot on this thing
Right
You mean I don't need a C and a D
No
It runs the whole the lot
Oh
Don't matter
Well that's more what I'm used to
X tree's more pretty in this isn't it
Where's the directory
There's er what's sub - d i r e c t o r y known as
Handle and then sub - d i r e c t o r y in D - b a s e
I think the sub dire we don't want the Gem
No
Cos I haven't sorted them out yet
Mm
Er I'm gonna sit down quietly and do it one day er m it's and make a sub - d i r e c t o r y
That's for storing
Can you scroll that down a bit
Oh
Hang on
Further
No just as bit more yeah
Leave your sub - directory as u til s
Yeah and I want to make the sub - d i r e c t o r i e s so that can
Make a sub - directory as
Make as sub - d i r e c t o r y as W P papers
It's gonna take as long as I thought cos I have to format it and install it
Make a sub - d i r e c t o r y as Word perfect fifty one
Actually that is that a sub - d i r e c t o r y or a main one
It's a sub - d i r e c t o r y of the root directory it's alright
I see
And that's it
And you've got a sub - d i r e c t o r y which says DOC S
Yes what
Have you ever used that
I don't think I have used it
Well you can always make no I don't need to make the rest because er m oh yes graphics
Make a sub - directory as graphics
Mac ro s
Do I need one for that
Oh yeah
You have mac ro s don't you
Yes
Just wanna call them the same things as you're used to
Printers no print yes print er will be the same won't it
Spell er
You call yours spell er
It's now
Yes
on
Right
Yes that's the end by the look of it
Pardon me
Oh well
Right
Let's take that out
No that one was brown that was
No and that one was brown
I tend to keep them in the originals cos then I if I need to
Mm
Now let's boot it and see what happens
No is it switched on
Take that out otherwise it'll boot all the disc drive
Okay
Should be alright
Good
Er Right can I have your er m all your bible ones
There's some
We've had those
They're all
Ah
over there I think
Yes here they are
Oh don't really need this
Never mind
Is this the order you put them up in
Yes
Oh so you'd like those in order put back in there
The only thing is I did wonder whether the two
What
there's two files at the end which I thought maybe ought to be at the beginning
Where are they
In there
Er
They're all in one big directory DO S
These two
doesn't care
You see those two are right at the end and those I don't know whether those ought to be together before X X
Well it they're
So
all in one directory
It doesn't matter
It doesn't care
I see
It's called Bible isn't it
Yes
Copy mm perhaps it doesn't like Oh that's the only thing
You're gonna get used to that
The se there's no second star
In that er Bible
Oh
That's cos I made a mistake if I did I forget to do a word there
No
Star
Oh
So that's drive B is it
Yeah
Star
I haven't bothered to make a label
No I don't blame you
Take them long enough wouldn't it
Alright
Mm
Right
I will get used this drive sooner or later
Boring this inn it
Yes
Still it has go got to be done
Well you could leave those couldn't you
No it's alright
I like to check that it all works you know
Get a few things on it and check that it works
It won't take long
Right you are
How many discs did you say this was
Twenty one of them
Mm
Er this one yes I think we'll put that
Yeah no I'm putting them that way on top of each other
That's right
Hopefully another coffee
I've just put the kettle on
Oh
I thought you might be ready for one
Actually they spend more time changing discs probably than the
Than the actual copying yes
Well you can't help it when you copy
Well look at the speed it takes a disc on to the hard disc
Watch
Now is that a file
That's a whole file
Oh yes it takes long spends longer reading than it is
Oh yeah
Much longer
Yeah
Well it's longer it's about ten times as long
Ha
Oh because that's the er
That's a slow floppy inn it
Mm
Flop pies are that is terrible
I'm up to book fourteen
You what
I'm up to book fifteen
Oh
Oh I'm more than half way through
Only nine left
Good
Suppose I could of put this out there
What are doing
It should be going down
Fortunately this'll be the biggest job of all
I suppose actually loading Word perfect will be the slow est job of all
Always takes a bit longer doesn't it
Mm
It's er there's not so many discs to load though
No
There's not so many discs
No but er I can't just do this with it
No
Where are you going
Just wanna look at those
I mean Auto route's only about three files
Only got
Yeah
three discs so that won't take very long
D - b a s e is what
Five at the moment
You know it says book forty do you have to know which books you want to go into
Yes er m er it's on a file somewhere
Oh
No is it
It's not the easiest thing to
No that's one of the
reasons why I've made little use of it
Er m
Never mind
I could probably re - n a m e them
To make it easier to remember except it maybe it refers to it maybe it uses book something to refer to them
You might have to write the whole programme again to do that
Oh well maybe I'd better not try then
There's some coffee here
Sorry I've nearly finished this
I'd like to get it done before I
Yes for the you know printing the leaf let
How much notice do you require
How quickly do they do it
The same day
Ah
Only I could take it to work you know
Mm
Er now then bring it on Friday and show it to G to Granville
I'll I'll get another copy
I'll leave that with Kenneth for now
Mm
and I'll bring one on Friday with me
I did ask I did mention it to Granville on Saturday
Aha
Because you know he said what it was gonna cost him in the future
So if we can save some cost
Mm
But it's once you get more than twenty copies
Yes
and that makes the copying quite reasonable
Oh I see it's not an ordinary photo copier
It it
Oh yeah
But they've got two
This one's called an an offset
Mm
print er
You you've got an ordinary photo copier and an offset
The ordinary photo copier works out a bit more expensive
Mm
But you see using the offset that case be I don't know what's
Well he'll generally want about seventy copies
Yeah
In that way it works out much better
Mm
Because there's an example there you know hundred two hundred whatever you want
There's an example there
Mm
Like I just really that we could reduce the scale of costing
A little bit
Well why not
You know
It's gonna help my school and it will help us as well
It will do two things won't it
Oh it's the school do does it
It's the school does it
Er m because we've got a printing system for the school th they'rethey're now letting out their printing services to others in the community
Mm
Er m so i if you like it's it's officially done because therefore they're advertising it in our last news letter we send to every parent
Mm
this ad ver t went on the back of it
So if anybody local ly wanted
So basically all I would have to do is take them with me and I'd bring them home on the same day
Mm
So it's done there and then
Apart from that I've got all the information we want here
Certainly you can
We have an open door
Well yes
the the whole of the
I thought but I thought it was er m I mean you haven't
Er no it's it's no we haven't had two sides
If you have two sides it'll be quite a few won't it
And sixty copies will be three pound
Cos some of these places in town people have to charge you VAT as well don't they
Which is
Oh yes yes
what pushes well if you go to somebody it pushes the cost up doesn't it
Mm
And a lot of the commercial ones charge you about ten pence a
Oh some of them charge you ten plus VAT don't they
Mm
Which is what adds it up you know really
So it would
Well run out now because I've got all the information I want
Oh well
You wanna leave it with me Alan do you
For Friday
Er I doubt if I I doubt if I'll see Granville before Friday
At least no if I do it will only be Friday morning
And I've got a funeral Friday morning I think
typing letters and that minutes a new typewriter
No she's learning how to use it
Oh yes
Er m they've there's all the different amount of things you've gotta learn I mean it's even different from a from a computer isn't it
You know it's
And a computer you've got a spell checker
Well she's got a spell checker on this one
got two capital letters
It's what
it's got one small letter and two capital s

No
Oh it's a it's a it's a good one
We bought it from Smith's on Saturday it's a Brother
But they were making an offer if you brought your old machine in they'd offer you thirty pound off
So we thought we may as well take it
Mm
Yes I I've been busy today
David's been helping me set up the I've I've just bought myself a three eight six
Oh
Well I've got er an electric typewriter
Originally my son had it and he went over to a print er
Mm
A computer and a print er mm
A word processor
A word processor yeah
Mm
You see the beauty of the beauty of the computer or word processor compared to an electronic typewriter is you can finish your document and then do your spell check
Yes
Whereas with the electronic typewriter you've got to do it er
Oh yeah
Yes
It's really a better faster ty ordinary typewriter in a way
Mm

Otherwise they're pretty well the same as an ordinary typewriter
But er with a word processor of course you can alter things
Mm
You can er
Mm
And of course you can shift er a block
Move it that way or some sort of thing
Do you take sugar Alan
No I don't thanks
Yes this was really rather extravagant getting this new one it was an
Does anybody want to buy an A ms t r ad
Are you giving it away
Selling it
Oh yes I know that
Thank you
Who else are we expecting
Er m
I think it's just Maria
I think it's only Maria not represented isn't it
I wonder if
Don't let me stop people finishing their teas
Anybody want a second cup of tea
Er
There's some more tea there I think
I'm alright thank you
Can we begin
Yes indeed
Sorry Alan
Er m I I think the only person missing i is I dr is so I don't

And Mrs is ill as you know R hod a is ill
And an apology from Merle from Salisbury Park
Right
Er m from the eighth chapter of the letter to the Romans For we are saved by hope
But hope that is seen is not hope
For what a man see th why does he yet hope for
But if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it
Likewise the spirit also help et h our in firm i ties
For we know not to what we should pray for as we ought
But the spirit itself maketh inter ce ss i on for us with g roan ings which cannot be uttered
And he that search es the hearts know et h what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh inter ce ss i on for the saints according to the will of god
And we know that in all things god works for good for them that love him
To them who are called according to his purpose
Let us pray
Father we pray that you will work for good with us
Help us as we look to the future
May we be guided by your spirit
May ou your spirit guide our prayers and our thoughts and our hopes
And father we pray that our hope may not be in vain but may lead us to sharing again in your kingdom
And father we pray too for those who are not well and unable to come
May they be sustained and kept according to their need
And father we pray for ourselves
And we pray too for those whom we represent
That we may work together according to your will so that you may work for good in us
Amen
Er Sadly although I sent you a letter with suggestions for discussion I forgot to keep a copy of it for myself
So but I hope if I stray too far from the path somebody will remind me
I suggest that the first thing is er m comments on what recommendation you will be thinking of making to the church in regard to the visit of er Mr and Mrs
Has anybody anything to say
No and do you want this
Oh maybe I should have it
Thank you
Er m
Well I think er several points should be ventilated and er I I think the while you're doing the agenda this evening you could add something to each item in turn
Mm
Er m
The only thing one would say though whilst agreeing with some of the the matters perhaps that may be aired have a bearing on the other matters in the agenda
Perhaps number one the one that's in the first paragraph
Yes
I'll be in a position to nightperhaps after some discussion to make a recommendation one way or the other
Yes
Well well er yes well from what I've already learnt and I've got to be rather blunt in this matter I'm afraid that Carol 's expectations
John
John rather's expectations regarding the amounts they're very ambitious indeed and I can't speak for Salisbury Park but if we're expected to pay a share of any alterations and so forth er m it would be very difficult for us to meet that commitment
Mm
Because we er if if his er m if his er desires were carried out we'd well we'd be talking about thousands of pounds
Literally
And the
Mm
I don't know whether I've spoken out of place because I'm not a member of Salisbury park but on the assumption that er m that we would have to share in the
Mm
expense you see of any changes
Are there any other comments on his visit
Er
Well ju just to keep the ball rolling my first impressions were good and he seemed to be er there was some drive about them
His sermon er well it was er m a reasonable sermon
We're not going to get a good preacher
The good preacher can get a much better church than this set up
So we're er we're sort of well down the list as far as that's concerned
Er m at first I was slightly put off by his choosing Cain and Abel as er
certainly yeah
the start the sermon but it it seemed to er develop reasonably
Er m but I was er that was my own impression
I rather admired what he's doing for Margaret because as far as I can see he's taking er as she's not able as far as I can see to er exist to live on her own and he seems to be taking over from elderly parents
But er m I was er somewhat put off altogether by comments I heard from people who had been in much closer contact than I was because I I saw him very little of him really
So I think other people have er a contribution to make which is well it would be important
Anybody else with a comment
Well personally I mean er m Margaret impressed me greatly but I think John was inclined to be full of his own importance for one thing
He was exceptionally demanding and my fairly long conversation was that he almost lead me to believe that he had got the job because when he started making comments about putting his grandfather clocks in the church er thirty of them
And building a
Thirty grandfather clocks
Yes
Oh goodness
What thirty
Thirty yes
Or or one
He said he was a collector of antiques so I said I'd better keep out of the way
Three O he said
But the other thing that worried me he was inclined to be er m mind you I felt aggression in his sermon a little but he did incline to be very uptight
Nervous
And I feel that er m coming to a good pastor ate I think he would with his history of having had trouble trouble I think possibly he he he would be ill
Mm
Because he was he was a bundle of nerve she couldn't keep still
And er you know he was I mean for instance at Salisbury Park he probably didn't mean anything but on Saturday when I was saying goodbye to him he said now I hope there'll be somebody here at ten past ten to open this church tomorrow
I like to be here half an hour before the service
So I said well I said I usually try to get here quarter past ten or soon after but it all depends on traffic because I live the other end of the town
Er however I got there at quarter past ten and he followed me in
And then no sooner got in he said by the way two glasses of water for me
I'm a two glass water man
So I said it's quite alright Mr we're not very well off in Salisbury Park but we do possess a ca rafe and that holds three
And then he said here's the hymn s put those hymn s up now
I said that's not my job it's the organ ist
But I thought oh dear me
That was my feeling and I feel that er
Not con du c ive to a
Not not for Salisbury Park
Not for me
No
I'll I can endorse that by saying that we shouldn't as I noticed a certain off handed ness with him that I didn't like at all
M hm
I I I don't know why he talks that of attitude but there we are
Mr chairman as a colleague I felt he was alright
Mm
We had a quite good fellowship together
I heard him here and I think our people was well impressed in some respect
We endorse what you said
There was a terrible nervousness which you don't expect from a man of that age and of that standing in the ministry
And then it was further endorsed because I went to hear him at Johns town and I thought to myself well I felt sorry that he was er m what's the word I want
Well he was er m oh I can't think of the word I want now but er he he was glued to his notes
M hm
You know
There was no freedom
No freedom
Er m not really and it was a a different type of sermon
Yes
Er I felt another thing which I I wasn't too happy about but then again one can soon change these things
For instance the the hymn s that he all had I presume at Salisbury Park er certainly with us and at Johns town and at the Rio where there's no alternative was all from the congregation
Yes yes
Now he knew beforehand because we told him when he came first came here that we also use Mission Praise and you do
And we do
I I would have thought personally I would have thought he would at least have chosen one from Mission Praise for the benefit of the be for the people who who like
Mm
that sort of thing you see
And I think
Well you do get more modern hymn s in that don't you
Beg your pardon
You get more modern hymn s in that
More modern hymn s and I should have thought you know er I would have liked him being a little more up to date
Mm
in that respect
Personally
I liked him as a man and I thought er Mrs was a delightful lady
She was a very sweet person
Oh she was delightful
Yes yeah
Er m but I think I can agree with what Nor ah has said er er er regarding the possibility of aggressive ness there
Mm
If I may just add one other thought
Whoever the minister that comes to us I think that they should accept the man se without question
That's what we like to do brethren
Mm
All down through the years
Haven't we
Yes
Some of them being too large
But we've had to bear with it
Too cold but we've had to bear with it
And why there should be such a change these days in that line I I I can't quite agree with it
Er for two persons two people that man se was adequate I would say
I was delightfully surprised with it myself
A reasonable
Well I know you were all seemed to be s you were all amazed when you went in
I could tell by the expression on your faces when only I felt
Yes I was amazed
it was only fair to take them in and then they know
I think ye
what we were talking about
Well
Yes you did right
But each one said ooh it's not as small as we thought it was you see
Mm
But er m it's just having that one room with a kitchen I think for if someone calls probably you see
Mm
Nice little room though
It could be
True
Table and a couple of chairs and portable television if you want it
Mm
Quite nice
And adequate
But er you know reasonable demands are all well and good
Perhaps if he if he if he could ask a thing like this then I'm sure Salisbury Park would oblige
But you know if he's saying well we do we would like the house re decorated all well and good
Oh well yes those are those are normal things
No but as er m Mrs has mentioned to me when it comes to er converting an existing garage into a den or a study and then asking for another garage to be built
Well you know it's not good enough is it
I would think that's out because it would destroy the value of the house er that that has got to be sold some time
House of course and it wouldn't suit another person would it
Yeah
But er I wouldn't agree that that er man se i that house is suitable for a man se
Mm
It wants at least one more room downstairs
It would be very unfair to er Margaret that every time somebody called she's got she's banished to the kitchen
And er he he could use the er h his vest ry or another room at the the church but somebody calling in the evening he's not going to take them over to a a cold room for an interview
But but if he knew if he knew Ken that they were coming
You know
Ah but then he wouldn't necessarily
Mm
But most people duly come surely make an appointment
But I I think
No some do some don't
I think in some way here with this particular situation as okay we we go into the question of the house now the house shouldn't be the issue here
No
Oh no not not
Wi with this situation the
The question has been raised that's right
Er m obviously the er and as Alan's asked us few weeks ago permission to explore maybe looking for the finances if and when it became the situation
That's right
But if er John came last week and to all of us we were of a like mind that yeshe fitted the calling here everything else I I see then that the man se would be the issue but basically now we're talking in many ways other issues are affecting the call here than the man se so therefore the man se goes down the the pecking order
Er m
But basically the matter we consider is John the suitable man for the ministry
Yes I I think I think that is the proper order to do things
Yes
I think first of all we want to know er as far as it's possible which of course is always er within the limitations of our abilities whether we think he's a man that we can recommend to the church that they should call him
Now the people I've heard speaking so far don't seem to think so
Is there anybody who disagrees with that assessment
Just to complete the picture
Well we had him for the weekend and er looking back on the weekend we were reasonably impressed with the man and his wife
And er from his conversation he appeared to be a homely sort of a chap and er he was outspoken but he would call a spade a spade
Er in church his di c tion was clear for all to hear
He spoke well to the children and er his sermon message did have a a reasonable amount of substance in it
But under the circumstances of being there on trial I did feel that he was very nervous
Er the Saturday evening we were in the lounge and chatting away for two or three hours and he he could not keep still
He was
Mm that's right yeah
moving to the left and to the right and sliding down
Down and moving his seat
He he
He's uncomfortable
He was uncomfortable
And when he was in the pulp it I felt that he was there was tension there was tension there
Mm
Er whether he did say in a conversation that he he knows when this nervousness er er and depression is coming on and he takes medication and it's alright
But er that's to be seen
I might add that I dr is rang me up last night I was on the telephone for about three quarters of an hour with him
That's typical I dr is
But he did ring up
He he said you're one person I can talk to you listen to me and I can talk to you and er he didn't want to worry you at that time but for him he didn't think he was suitable
Even I dr is who er they're desperate for but he I dr is didn't think you know he could cope with the four church es
Well I dr is rang me up last night which is not unusual because he often rings you know
Yeah
once a week to me and I ring him occasionally and er his first remark which was quite er m natural he said well you know Ernest he said I've heard many ministers
Yes
Like we all have haven't we
And we'rewe're all guilty of being critics
Mm
Mm
But er m I dr is said in effect which is an expression which we've all used at some time or another he did nothing for me
That's right yes
In invert ed commas
He did nothing for me
Mm
Mm
Mm
You see
And er I knew what I dr is was referring to you see
I thought
Somehow or another er m I dr is and I have clicked somehow or another and er m I understand him and he understands me
Mm
And that's how we've er been able to get on so well together
Yes same here
Same here
you know
Yeah
Er but I would add this to you know please do not depend in any way upon Ber i a
No cos he
Because it's it's folding up it's dying quickly
Yes
I'm I'm afraid that is so
That is so
I I don't I honestly don't know what we're going to do about Ber i a
No I don't but So it's more or less a three some if anything at all
Mm
Really
I thought his nervousness was because of the ordeal of you know er being before us as a
But it shouldn't be after all that time
you know
This was one of the one of the things I asked him wasn't it
When we were when we were
Yes
talking afterwards about the team ministry and working together and the problems and his experiences
You're not nervous are you Peter
No but u under the circumstances a man that a man who
take the biscuits
yeah who has er had ner v you know
Yeah
a nervous problem
Mm
perhaps it was because of the situation
Mm
You know and perhaps if he came he would overcome it
Yes
I agree but I think that anybody who speaks in public you have nervousness beforehand and the moment you go to talk to the people you know what you're going to say you have a few notes in front of you and you talk to the people if that is your job
Absolutely
It's what you do
Yes
No matter how much your knees tremble underneath underneath the table
But you talk to people with the fer v our of what you want to tell them
That's true
Er I I think I would agree with you there that I mean it's natural to be nervous
Absolutely yes
in a situation like that
Yes
but usually once one gets sort of started it it gets better
And he he possibly had done it at least a half a dozen times
Oh must have done
Yes
Mm
Even even if he wasn't accepted on a first occasion he's probably had another two or three attempts elsewhere
Yeah
So he's done it before
And and lots of church es that he was telling us that he'd been in contact with
And he must have gone to those church es for the first time
And I don't suppose that you know a new ministry is so very different from meeting people in a new church
That's right
People are the same everywhere
Well yes
And they are all there willing you to do well
Yes yes
Whatever you know audience you're speaking in front of
I mean of course you're going to be judged adversely perhaps but i in a church you are being listened to by people who are of like mind and therefore willing you to have something of value and interest to say to them
Er yes that that is important because qu I mean when you feel that people are sympathetic
Mm
then it's easier to speak
Mm
Oh yes
And we wouldn't have invited him if we weren't sympathetic would we
Hardly
You know
Oh well if he's a nervous person he wouldn't think like that would he
Well exactly
No I feel that this ties in with his nervous breakdown
Mm
We had a somewhat similar experience at a previous church I was at where we were looking for a minister and the the man er who was who came to us was again very nervous and excitable and so on
Fortunately we had a doctor in our congregation who er was s had some knowledge of psychiatry and he had a fairly long session with him just the two of them
And he strongly recommended us not to accept this man
And this man went to another church not so very far away so we knew what happened and certainly we were very glad we accepted our doctor's opinion
Mm
Mm
Well it looks as though er there's a fairly clear majority against er making a call as far as I read it
I don't do you want a show er do you want to vote
Oh does anybody know the of the y the younger people the younger members of the church es
Did he appeal to the younger members
Or
No
Not not as far
oh well
Er
if we send a recommendation to
a recommendation to the church you see so I
Er m
You must know the feeling of this meeting first mustn't you
Yes
But one one would say no I mean I don't disagree with what you said about er the children's address well I do personally
Yes
Er m he the same children's address here as he did in Salisbury Park
Did he
Mm
I would think so about the elephants
That's right
Yeah
Right
And in in er
Our children weren't
the children didn't even know he was talking to them
Mm
He stayed up on the pulp it or whatever didn't he
Er m you see if this the pulp i the didn't come s
Yeah
And what I was gonna say Alan was perhaps like Mr you know we had one of the ones sitting here that did go up to two services
I also went to Johns town yesterday
So I heard him in Salisbury Park last week and in Johns town yesterday
I felt a a degree of obligation because of my commitment with Johns town now
Mm
so I went to Johns town yesterday afternoon
Well I I've gotta be honest in what I'm saying I sat through two services yesterday the morning service did a lot for me
But the afternoon service did nothing
Mm
The morning service in fact I would I've gotta say it Nor ah
Mm
The minister we had taking the service yesterday morning I think felt as much on trial in Salisbury Park
I'm sure he did
Yes he did
Yes yes
because he was a student with us
It was
Mm
Yeah
M hm
And had come back yesterday
He was nervous wasn't he
He was
Yeah
after his first appointment was as much on trial as Kenneth
Yeah
And but yesterday
Hasn't he improved
relaxed
Definitely improved
un wound himself and you could tell his two years what it had done for him
Hadn't it just
Marvellous
But
yes incredible
a number of people said to me how much they enjoyed yesterday's service
Mm
Yeah
He also took a communion service again which was
yeah
But I came home and feeling I could relate all I'd
Yeah
But I sat in yesterday afternoon and I felt sorry for the man's daughter who'd been given a hymn the service
Who was put on a spot
Er m and as you said he he couldn't leave his notes
Cos I'll have to confess to you I saw him diligently once looking below the pulp it
at his at his notes
Yeah
of what he was gonna do next
Yeah
Er m there was the whole time a sense of anxiety about him
Alright he knew he had to go to afterwards half past three but he couldn't unwind one bit there
And there are occasions I think we all agree alright we have to have notes but you must unwind a little bit to get near to the people
And I would not feel that Kenneth would ge could get near to any one of us
Mm
But I hate to say it because obviously he wants to find to go somewhere
But I don't think this is the place
And heart to heart having sat through two I went home it was heavy
Mm
Well a lot of our people said they liked him didn't they
Yes oh yes
Yes
Yes er m you see we're in a different different situation than what you are at Salisbury Park
We haven't had to make a demand upon our congregation to make such a decision for twenty two or twenty five years you see
Mm
Whereas you've had to do that at Salisbury Park you see
May I just say I went to er m Johns town yesterday because I had half promised our friends here that I would go to support them
Mm
It wasn't actually my Sunday
I I'd forego 'd that Sunday afternoon for agreeing to come there
That's why I went
But I I also wanted an endorsement
Mm
of what I heard the previous week
Mm
And I think naturally we would all like that
Er m
Well going back to the very first meeting that we had
Mm
I did come away that er really wasn't struck
But I didn't like at all the er excuses he made for his wife
er that we weren't employing her
Mm
Well right - o h we er I don't think we ever do expect that much
But all the same at the same time we do expect them to mix
Mm
If they're going to mix with the church then they'll be only too happy to take some part in it
Mm
But then in the sermons when he came here to preach er I didn't see any sign of nervousness myself
Couldn't see any sign of nervousness myself but er I'm very happy with his sermons quite good
But er at the same time the further I go on the more app re hens ive I get about it
Whether coming here or not and I don't really think that you know coming back to it I don't think he would fit in
Mm
Er well
We are rather an old congregation there's no doubt about it apart from the here
But er you can I mean we've got of course I'm not too young myself but er we are set in our ways
Mm
And that takes up with the
Can't alter that
What bothered me most was the fact that he
Mm
What bothered me mo well wha one of the things that bothers me is the fact that he said that he wouldn't like to do hospital chaplain cy because he wouldn't like to go visiting because he's got no small talk
And I'm just wondering what the the knock on effect of that is in the visiting of the the members who can't get into church and who can't receive communion in church and who may like to receive it in their home or in the homewhere they live
Because you don't just suddenly go in give communion to someone and walk away again do you
Mm
You you ha you establish a rapport of listening for a little while to whatever it is that they've got to say and their troubles and their an x i e ties and I wasn't happy that
Mm
there would be that sympathy
I'm certain that the sympathy is there with his wife
Yes
Yes
Absolutely
But I don't how much that compassion and love for fellow people goes beyond his wife to the congregation
Mm
I don't know
I don't know
Mm
And if if he says to us in meeting that he's got no small talk and no er m ability for visiting in a hospital situation where you can ask people how they are and then can move to the next person you've got to see I'm not sure how he would be visiting someone in their home
Mm
It's also a question isn't it of whether you appoint a man because he's a good preacher or secondly because he's a good pastor
That's really the question isn't it
Mm
You never get the two
You can't get the two
You're very lucky if you do aren't you
I would say the second is the more important
The more important being a good pastor
Yeah but you must that that that your congregation that all the people in the pastor ate must know that they can go to you and that you will listen
Yes that's
And that you they they that they will have for the time that they are in your company your whole attention
And your whole mind concentrated on what happens to be concerning them
Whatever else you've left behind at home
Mm
But for that moment you are there for them
I in their service
You know
Mm
In other words the skills of a counsellor
Yes
Yes
Definitely
Definitely
Er well as far as I can see er m with with a few minor reservations the the elders would prefer not to recommend to the church that a call be issued
Ha have I got it right
Mm
Yes
I think you are right
I think
Well you've got to have a unanimous decision haven't you
Mm
And I mean yo you know there's three to one isn't it
Er m oh you mean in favour
In favour yeah
of a call
Yeah
Yes
Well certainly I mean one would want to have a substantial majority in favour of a call to issue it
Now whether in fact the church meeting would come to a different conclusion from us I've no means of knowing but probably not because most of you know something about the church that you're working with
Well impressed with
That's what I'm saying
Ourour people seemed
They all liked him
our congregation yesterday and er m the feeling I got was that er m we couldn't support a minister ourselves and we're and well at least the congregation think that they're there entirely to help Salisbury Park
Er m and I think I go with them o on these lines
And we're hoping to get something out of that sale
Mm
and what we're trying to do is p lo ugh whatever we get back into the group
Mm
so that er m more or less Salisbury Park are the people who really Th they said that whatever the decision decision they make they would fall in with them
Mm
So er it looks as if the decision 's against so I'm almost sure that the decision at Johns town will be against
Well



George George
Want a scratch
Mm do you want a scratch

He's been out the car and locked me in it
Yes even if I go anywhere if I go to go into a shop I always lock the car always

Ar r r
Why's he up there for
I think what it is 'cos I'm out so much at time now
And they don't have much time for him
uh oh
Where before
there for
Scratching him and playing with 'im you know
You know when the eyes kept itching last time and I said I wondered if it were 'cos of birds
No your eyes
Yeah you know two times I've been and me eyes are going right mad
Just a minute while your mum tells me
'cos of bird you've always had Bobbie
Always had 'im
started again today
Mind you he does chuck a lot of stuff about 'cos you can see
Yeah
You're always dusting with him 'cos he's right dusty
Right er maybe that's what it is then
seems funny though it's only started
Albert says I've got to sell 'im
Shall we sell you
Mm
Who's gonna make you scratching his bloody head and he's made his head bleed
would you have Colin about him
Well
Colin
I ended up paying for him
She's not bothered she never goes near him
Never goes near him
She never goes near him
She's frightened to death of 'im
isn't it
I know
But I don't think Geoff would be very pleased
Well if you say to him that just say that and that that's you know oh just say something like just say something like I can't keep up with him Dennis he's throwing loads of dust about just say to him think about selling to you want to buy him back or you know
Well they won't I don't think they'd have him back
No and that's a
I don't think I don't think sell him
Has he got to wait
A.
I don't think you'd get what you paid for him
Probably not but I mean cage is worth a hundred and fifty quid
That's what Russell paid for the cage
Ohlook
Mm
Ohlook
What
Look
that he's into
Well I mean he's no problem to me
I'm not bothered about him
You know I'd rather keep him than sell him but
It's like everything else you've always sum mat else to bloody feed
Mm
By the way when we had that pair that were driving me madand then that one died when we were in bungalow
Other one would learnt how to open a crack and it were in that cage and it could hear birds outside
Anyway in the end we let er Kenny's grandad have 'im I mean 'cos they got me mum's bird
They've got two of his own he ended up with four birds
Yeah
But at least they were happy you know what I mean
'Cos they were with other birds
But I never missed I never missed him
I don't think you get attached to birds like you do animals
I don't think you get attached to birds like dogs
Not like dogs and cats
No
I mean Albert said if we do get that bungalow we are 'cos the owner he said she'll disappear
She'll disappear
I mean I'll be upset about our Whisky 'cos we're I mean we've had a long time although she's not a pet pet you know what I mean
What feel like
Well they they just they go away when you take them somewhere fresh
and they don't know where they are
That one
They're very very
Sometimes you're lucky and you know if if you keep them in long enough
We've always had cats always had cats when we lived at and we moved into and we'd had this one cat years it were old cat
I wouldn't say it was ready for popping off you know what I mean
Yeah
It were always fit and we were only there a fortnight three weeks disappeared
I mean if our Whisky died I wouldn't be as upset about it as I would about these
But if she disappeared I'd be worried all time
And yet
Aye
You know like when our Dawn 's kittens disappeared
It they weren't bothered I think Mick took them away me self
Yeah
I'm convinced he did
I think he did
But I were I were upset about that you know
without a break
No it's a can't be in the garden can he
Yeah
Same as with these next door
I get right upset about P add y
I mean she's give his kennel away now and he's got no kennel again
Ar
And he's running streets and you know how cold it was last week and he's running streets
What she give kennel away for then
I don't bloody know
I think she'd give the dog away as well
Saw him coming
Don't lick don't let him lick her Karen
Don't lick
You mutt
all right
I've been round me mum s this morning

And the nerI said I've just come to see if you want any c i g s
She said well our John's coming down tonight she said just get me twenty
I said you might as well get forty I said because if he's late coming down
Yeah right
And he can't round shop after you'd be stuck and I mean he
I don't Albert don't mind going for her c i g s but it's just that we don't get up early in the morning you know and if me mum's ringing at eight o'clock in the morning 'cos she got no c i g s
It's a bit unfair like when when she could at
I said she said after my job at
Margaret's not very well
she hadn't seen Margaret since Christmas Eve
Yeahbut she ain't been bad since Christmas Eve
Oh no
no
But she
O v over a month ago
When they came on Sunday when it were your anniversary she'd got dia r r hoe a and sickness Margaret
I think she were off work last week
Yeah
I I mean you're anything like that but not not for a month I mean
I got two toilet papers on
Oh yeah
Well put one in your pocket then
I Margaret last night
Oh I I bet if you look at it
I don't Pete's been to me mum's for about six months
Because I can't remembering him going
He never goes without Margaret
She always goes herself she were down there last night by herself
He were at pub
Mm
Well I said to her told her about not having nowt to eat from that Wednesday morning er Wednesday dinner time till Thursday when they went
Well she took away fish last night for her supper
Oh
And that she she looked shocked you know she didn't didn't know me like and er well she was shocked and then I said I said right well we'll have to get together and sort something out about stopping with her and Pete said straight away
Margaret's there every days he goes out every morning
Right
Not that he actually asked her
years ago about Be ry l
I told you that's what he said
And I said aye up I don't mean in day - t i m e
I says on a night - t i m e I said you know she can't leave her home now I said she can't manage to put coal on fire and she can't manage to get up up to eat and drink and that I said I don't mind dropping off and taking me turn on the night - t i m e but I mean but it's hard it's hard with me with kids every night
It's for you with kids
But I don't certainly don't mind taking her down once a week or twice a week and taking me turn
Karen there's no need no need you're needed at bloody home
I mean there's only you got kids
There's no reason your Margaret can't stop when he's on nights
Or after s
No
I mean 'cos we can all down
Only days really what's difficult for him
Yeah
I don't think Pete 'd stop
really
I mean he only got to get his clothes on and go to work the same
I don't think he'd go stop
Our Margaret might go stop herself but I don't think he'll go
Ah
You're bending
Watching ya
Will you settle down
No
I don't think Margaret would want to stop actually
No I don't think they would
None of em will
But er I don't think
If no one will go down there at all and and sit with their mother for a for a couple of hours
No
I mean I can't talk because I never go
Er to say 'cos I mean I closest and I don't go
Yeahbut I was your
But er me and me mum's never got on like our Margaret and me mum have
No
It's same as what ow she's gone into hospital with her you know and I'd actually been that day you know what I mean I don't mind don't get me wrong I'm not cross 'cos I don't mind
But it annoys you they they they think they're doing a lot for her 'cos they go in ev every morning
Yeah they're more thought of
Yeah
More thought of
Has he
Yeah
I mean I know but Colin ain't been down much this week because Colin 's been working he's been working every day and that you know what I mean it's been a bit hard for us to get down but we tried
Yeah
who should try and pick kids up and then have an hour down there
Well he spends more time there than me
'Cos I've been this morning and I've cleared fireplace out washed
No you're not wearing your shoes in here
and I've 'oo ve red up
and dusted and polished
That kitchen floor could do with washing I saw a mop but didn't see no bucket
I don't whether she's got one but I thought I didn't have time to do it this morning
Mm
So I just run round with 'oo ver and dusted and polished then I made a cup of tea
Who's doing the washing
Our Margaret
Ah
I can't our Margaret's drying it on radiator sand I says to Albert what me mum doing with the dryer
He says I don't know
It's still there
So I'm gonna ask her if I can borrow it
It's
and then now I'll do her dryer washing for her
Yeah
I mean I only really wanted to dry me towels because I hate having to run out la un launder ette while I'm drying all me other clothes on radiator s
It's more expensive to use
Yes
I know it's more expensive
Sa sha
but it's really only for towels
Come in and shut that door
What you got
Get shout Barney in
Shout Barney
Barney
I don't whether she doing ironing I know she's doing washing
Oh alright
'Cos she's well that day Albert took me
Barney
mum to ' o spit a land I er she give me a lift
She dropped her washing off
I thought she'd dried it and she said oh I'm just gonna put this washing on radiator sand then it it were then that er it made me think well what done with her dryer
Yeah I know
Well 'cos I mean she can't be paying much electric
It's not that that your Margaret ain't got time to stop there and dry it for her you know what I mean
Oh all you got to do is put it in somebody'll take it out
Yeah
Go over there no don't she won't go outside keep them on there
Yeah
I don't know
I mean your Margaret sent a dinner down last night
you know what I mean the
Yeah she she said she might
she's took er fish and that and she's tried in ways like that
Yeah
I mean I can't afford to take care
We tried to
We can afford to keep afford to dog
And Margaret's dad when they when my kids were little would never take our kids anywhere but they
It were me dad it were me dad that didn't take up
And always relied on one or the other I don't
Me dad wouldn't me dad didn't mind taking
I don't care which one
But they would never take 'em out for day
No I know
But they would fetch 'em and pay for them and I even today you cannot buy love
No
And it's proven my point our Dawn wouldn't even think about there
Our our Cor in ne goes round when she got to
Don't think about what
Our Cor in ne don't only go round when she got to
She goes round
Goes round weeks ago
Well she won't go and stop
Said she won't go and stop again
Who's gonna stop then
When we were all on about stopping
I don't mind going and doing her shopping and bits she says I'm not stopping
Yeah
When you were on about that love what pa was saying about you know like every night that our kids when they had their pyjama s on and they're like to get hold I'm lying watching television I'm usually falling asleep but I put the kids you know
And er last time I I get in touch me mum told me turned round and says to me I don't want any more mum I says why he says oh she won't let me have pillow and then I then I think if sum mat else brought to light I kill her
Yeah
if she had come in
Yeah
and that I know it's a filthy old thing but it it's comfort ain't it
Yeah
And when they start let them have the pillow down they don't feel they can't get comfortable
I know it's a little bit trivial like but it's just it's still
She has queer ways me mother
Karen I I'm forty - s e v e n and I can't work me mother out so no chance for you working her out few years you've known her
No no I I I mean she's always been alright with me really I me any you know she's not not at all mother - i n - l a w s h e ' s not
Well me and me mum's me and me me mum's never been close
It were always like me and our Colin were more or less with me dad and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum
Then when they got older me dad sort of took our John on because our John were mechanical minded and our Colin got pushed out a bit 'cos our Colin weren't interested in cars
I found this
Oh yeah oh that's what that bird
Yuk
And our Colin was to be off t' fair and that some dad sort of went on to our John and pushed our Colin out a little bit
Yeah
But er me and our Colin 's never been me mum's favourite
It's always been our Margaret
Mind you did you see that photo that
Yeah
You are I mean I could just work out I said your Margaret and John are a lot like you
She is 'cos she's got Margaret's lips and your nose but out of all of you I think your your Jo you can see your John in it can't you more than anybody
I always think our John looks more like a Prescott 'cos he al every time I see him I see me Uncle Bill more and more
Yeah John used to say years ago about how much that you're John looks like your Brian and I don't think he looks anything like it
No I don't
And she again now she says like somebody your John look like that bloke next door
What a load of rubbish I thought well
No
He looks more and more
Aye
our Colin 's getting more and more like me dad
Well Brian ain't it
Brian Brian I think don't like er
they are they're all like that
All of them
And I think our John looks like me Uncle Bill
Yeah I think he does
But then again he did look like that photo I think he does look like that photo but you were younger then
Yeah
but he does look like Uncle Bill
Mind you Colin 's getting more like your dad every day
I know he is
black weld ing glasses on and he turned round and he made me jump
Like oh Colin and then he go like this you know isn't it
You know he'll come running glasses
Yeah
I can't do it
And right he made me heart jump 'cos he looked just like your dad and then a few days later he's in garage again and Johnny come in and he said God he said he gave me a flaming heart attack out there
I said why and he said he turned round with these glasses on then he said it was just like John's stood there
I says don't tell me I said he did the same thing to me the other day and it were only within a couple of days of each other
When he puts those glasses on honestly he's his double
I think it's the way he looks like if you know what I mean you know like pull his face and like look over glasses I mean he did it to me when did it to Johnny
He probably thought like
He's like me dad er me dad he never had no patience and our Colin 's just like him
Mind you I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways
I haven't got a lot of patience
But where where we're better off 'cos Albert he's calm where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered
Yeah
Where when I start Albert's
He I tell you want he doesn't do I shouldn't let you hear but when he when him and me are arguing when we were younger and me dad used to wind Colin up and wind me up and I'd get madder and madder and me dad used to love it
But looking back you know and now that's what Colin does to me he winds me bloody up but I can't help it because he gets me that wild I should just I should I mean how can you change his temperament
I mean I should just turn round and tell him where to go but
I think Colin winds you up sum mat chronic
I know
And instead of just
Ignoring him
Ignoring him
You don't he and he going through bloody
Yeah I know
What
A where
No
Bird pooh on window
But I meaner
Where the birds have pooh ed on me window flying past
Oh God

He thinks a lot about ya
Yeah
Right duck

You're not by your bloody self
I'm not f rigid or ow t
I can't see are neither of you passionate
No
I keep saying to him look Colin I said I know a couple of times a week's enough for me but that's worth waiting for but when you're doing it three times and then get sick of it

Look at that flaming dog
Come on come on throw them over there
I wonder if there's any way you can actually check you know where he is is there any way that
Watch me tea now
straight out or
Well what what do you think er m
Are you worried about how much money it's gonna cost ya
No because money's cost us less
Er you know when they said we had to pay two hundred and fifty one for er administration and search and survey
It's come back and it's under two hundred
Can I have a cup of tea please
Then they said I've got to pay five hundred pounds for
Do what love
I don't think Allied Dunbar will deal with anybody that's dodgy
No
Er
Now watch that tea
Yeah
That's what he said
Are you ready
I don't think they'd deal with anybody that dodgy
Er
Bert
Are you doing alright are ya
What they do they look they look around and they weigh up up pros and cons up and it it's like these insurance brokers they ring all over to buy cheapest insurance for you wellthat's what Allied Dunbar are doing
Well well this is a broker but it's a broker so that's
Yeah
You see what it is it's where they've been behind with their mortgage we will pay a slightly higher rate but it's only
Yeah
a matter of about er I think I think the mortgage now is ten point nine and we'll be paying eleven point something
Yeah
So it's only a matter of a
Yeahbut one per cent 's a hell of a lot you know
It's a penny in the pound
Yeahbut I mean it it will drop it will drop again
But the thing is also what I thought of once we gotta us a mortgage and got established you could always re mortgage and go into er like Bradford and B ing ley and come out like that
Yeah once you get it back up to
Yeah
Yeah well that's
Well I thought once we get
It'll not be a dodgy one
Put it in there then
It won't be it's not forced to be a building society
No it isn't
It gonna to be a building society
Ohwell it might be Abbe y National
No it's come back it's got Target Finance on it
Ah
Well that's o that is a finance company and not a building society
If it says finance it doesn't mean a building society
Nine times out of ten it's a finance company
Same as er Merc an tile and
Well 'cos I mean we dealt with Merc an tile we dealt with Key Finance
Yeah
Er
We've dealt with sum mat Wagon
Key that when we first bo when we first bought our car through that Scott is that bloody bank
Scottish Amicable
Scottish Amicable
Like Widows
They're always ringing up
They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at night
Yeah
Asking us whether we want to borrow some money
Er asking if there's anything we co look at him walking about with that
Everything everything what oh papers have got has got Legal and General on it
Mm
So I thought well
Yeah
it can't be a a dodgy
I don't think it'll be anything dodgy
It won't be dodgy
Oh
But you can always easily find out
What usually happens though
All you do is pick the phone up and and get oh now what place do you ring
I forgot what place you ring but we're find out and you ring up to see what they're what the company's like
You know if it's a variable company
Yeah
Things like that you could do that
Different companies take over I remember that time we borrowed that four thousand pound
We started out with Key Finance and we ended up with Merc an tile Credit didn't we
Yeah
Changed companies three times that time we had that four thousand pounds
You told me about that yeah
Well said that it will be a s m a really small building society
He says that 'cos er it's not
Well
Big building societies are not prepared to give you rates and small building societies are wanting to get going
You see the only trouble with building societies is it's the same when you buy a pig g ing house they put the money on what you've actually borrowed every year
Yeah
Well finance companies only you only get the interest on what is left
On the money that you owe
Yeah
That's the difference
And between them both you can you could I mean you take a ten thousand pound out with a mortgage mortgage and you could end up paying what twenty thousand twenty four thousand back
Yeah
Well finance company
You you borrow ten grand or twenty grand whatever you like to and you get a certain amount put on that and that's it it's fixed
No
You don't pay no more
Say you'll you'll you'll get twenty thousand five hundred that if you buy if you borrow twenty thousand just for er round figures
You borrow twenty thousand and the interest payments works out
Ben j i
very high
He's alright
It's very high you know the interest payments are very high but for that money you've borrowed you'll only pay say just for a a figure five hundred pound back for that twenty thousandfive you know
Yeah
five thousand pound not
Not paying it for years and years all the time
But if you borrow it from a in er mortgage company you're gonna you're gonna borrow twice that you gonna have to pay twice that much back
Forty grand you k n that's the only difference and
I don't mind that so much though 'cos they say we are paying a lot less back a month than other way
But I just got one thing that I want that they gonna send me ow t dodgy like a loan shark bloke or ow t like that I mean you you're bound to be a bit nervous you know
No they won't send a loan shark
You you can tell loan sharks straight away because the A P R's about twenty seven per cent
Ma maybe twenty nine even thirty depending but if it er mind you I don't know because it's a long time since I had a look at 'em
But you know when you when you borrow money you get er an interest rate don't you over so many yo you've got to figure out ho how many years you're gonna pay it back
You know
If you say oh we'll take it over ten years
Well you've got ten years interest to pay ain't ya
So you pay the interest for for nine years and they start paying your loan off
We're still having trouble getting insurance and er anyway I phoned and I wrote him again yesterday and he's given this number who er who he's with
'Cos he had a right job got plastic 'cos he even plastics I mean that's
Yeah
In flam m able ain't it
Anyway er the bloke who managed to get him insurance this this the premises are insured with him
Yeah
so I thought well if he's already got er part of his insurance without having
Yeah because he was in paper waste paperand the fire insurance on that must have been colossal
That's where cardboard and paper
Yeah
Sa sha come in here shut door
He's not coming in
But er I can't understand whybecause I mean let's face i the he's only using f ib re - g l a s s and they're not that flam m able
No what they're saying is
Not the flam m able it's the er indemnity nobody can breathing it in who's in
Ohyeah yeah
They're frightened like in years to come like they're gonna try and make a claim against them 'cos their er been on the chest is sum mat like that
Yeah
I it's health and safety yeah
er
Through the health and safety but
Eighty four we had this extension put up
Yeah
Sa sha come in here
But after saying that
There's a dr aught in
what you gotta do is make up your mind what chemicals you're gonna use
Yeah
and then find out all about
What ya got
Don't know
them particular chemicals and then submit it to the the insurance company what them's the only chemicals you use and the company said this and that
they told him that
Yeah
Yeah
And they still
See he's off again I bet it is
Just started itching
Well he has just flown about
I say he's just flown round bloody house
He has
Yeah
Oh
I bet
'cos I thought I'd look
Aye
I couldn't
It might be dust out of his wings
Yeah I every time I come here
Nineteen ninety one ninety two
I must have sensitive eyes
Eighteen hundred and fifty two
Dear me
We've had that pebble - d a s h nearly nearly it's nearly two years since they did that pebble - d a s h
Cost us two thousand nine hundred and in two years we've only paid eight hundred nine hundred
A hundred
A hundred and forty pound
we've paid off in two years Karen
How much
A hundred and forty pound
In two years
In two years
Now if that had been a finance company I would have paid a damn sight more
But it cost us thirty seven pound a month
But last year we put no wait a minute last year we paid 'em four hundred and eight pound fifty two and they put two hundred and seventy two pound fifty interest on
So actually all we paid was
Thirty seven per cent
Thirty odd thirty
That's round about thirty - s e v e n per cent inn it somewhere around there
Yeah we paid thirty eight pound off it last year
Makes more
It's ridiculous you know mortgage payments
When you think of it
I know
and on ' o use they put eight hundred and ninety eight pound you could say nine hundred pound interest on ' o use
O i
I don't know how they get away with mortgage payments like they are because you know it it's totally unfair
They are
I mean alright we know you're handling large lumps of money but when you think of it if you if you borrowed it at a different rate you know same rate as you could do finance 'cos which I think the government could do it and make a profit at it
Yeah
You know what I mean
Instead of having all these different mortgage companies Abbe y National and that the government have er have era whats name to do it they're wouldn't be half and a quarter
I mean it happens all over the world you know in in the in the especially in the whats name countries
I know
Communist countries
Everything's owned by the by the government and er I know it's not a right good thing like but if it could work properly it would be a damn good thing
Watch she don't bite ya
I mean communism in England
in it's in it's proper form would be a wonderful thing but er it's on because er it's only the rich people what make people poor
I know
The say as with damn education like at bloody Tory so ds they took all blink ing we gi for al for all these people what's going to college every time they drop on holidays they've got nothing to keep 'em
No
So I my opinion what this government's doing is stopping stopping the lower class well I say lower classes the lo the the
isn't it
poorer people they stop 'em getting educated
That I'm I'm almost convinced
Yeah
It says everything they're doing it says is going back to the eighteenth century when you hear about these Kat h Catherine Cooks on days working for pennies and you can't get educated
un cutting back
They're cutting back on education
Oh you're telling me
They're making it so only the rich can be educated
Yeah trying to turn it back into
at the end of the day
I mean our Colin 's there waiting for a grant and what's happening
Sweet nothing
Now we're it were in bloody paper last on Thursday they don't get nothing when they're on holiday
No they don't
I mean how the hell they supposed at eighteen year old without a job
Mm
If they have a job they don't get no grants
And how can you have hold a a job down
I don't think
And do education at same time
I'm not sure but I think I don't got my family allowance until I were eighteen I think I think they used to give us
let me keep our Karen's
Oh
So I've got a form to fill in actually
It should have gone back last week and I
It'll all stop when she gets her grant through
Don't knock me
She said not necessarily
I think it will stop them thought shit I'm not bloody going to declare it
Yeah
She applied for a grant and in er in career it says like
Sa sha
you'll like you you
No you'll rip it
Left home you know we are like say our Karen to leave home
Aye
Yeah
And she were living in the parks
Get up here
Yeah
They used to give 'em subs i dies to help 'em pay the rent they've stopped that so they've either to ger ra job to help put supplement to pay in the you know their housing accommodation or they've got to stop school
In summer holidays er the grant don't they take that six weeks
Off the grant
off the grant so that actually they get six weeks money less through the year than they should do where they're used to paying all through year
For twelve months now they don't
Now they don't get anything for that six weeks that they're not at school
No
So you know any girl that's not living at ' o me
She got to go out and work for that six weeks to to earn the money feed the
And where can you get that bloody kind of money only corner
Yeahbut where can you get a job
Wellthat's it
Where can you job
Well it's forcing the girls on to streets ain't it
Yeah
corner
I mean they're begging 'em you to k e they're begging you to keep 'em on at school and yet you can't get no help to keep 'em on
It's like other day we were talking to this bloke like and he were on about businesses says you can't unders t oh he said something about finance show difficult it is to get finance to start a business up and er he said I know he said you can't me he said
You seen all these ad ver t s about starting your own business you know governments like you know doing all these courses and making it out as though it's it's dead easy to get fi you know hitting your head against a brick wall
Yeah
The only way you can start a business is by starting it without insurance
straight off your own back and then you know after it's running get insurance
Yeah
That ho ninety five per cent of firms do that
regulate
I mean it's
I mean look at lad do round there what's been broke into
He's no insurance no insurance whatsoever 'cos he couldn't afford it
I know
Ours is gonna us about a thousand pound for insurance
Oh
Well a thousand pounds not a lot Karen but er it all depends what the what what you gonna be insured for
It's not
I mean even that you're gonna you you gonna be insured for breaking in and break - i n s and
Yeah I think it's everything
I think it's
That's what I mean so what you're actually getting for your thousand pound isn't a lot of money
No
I think it's covered for like like you say like for some reason say you had a fire and you had to stop work
Yeah
I think it's covered for that
Covered for personal injury er covered for hundred thousand for like that's what trailers they've got trailers in
It's covered for everything
I mean you imagine somebody breaking in and setting fire to a trailer
I mean it's a lot of money when you think Nor ma's paying nine hundred pound just for her car
For that Cab rio let
To me you think p he w a thousand pound but cer I mean it's it ain't really very much no
It's a high insurance for a car
What for car
yeah
Right
What how how comes that then
Because well Cab rio let's are class ed as dangerous aren't they because they're soft roofed
Oh aye
It's not got no
Aye this
Yeah she's only been driving a year two years
Soft top yeah
Yeah
Well I mean look at our Connie's
Yeah
Three hundred and eighty for third
Our Connie's were five hundred and seventy
Now it's gone up to five hundred and seventy because that accident
I mean when you look at it it's for a third party fire and theft
Christ that's gonna be a thousand pounds on a full comprehensive just about
I know
I'm still
Are ya
Well I I I'll promise not to fond le
need to tell her
Connie get in touch with me again I told her that
I don't know
Tell the truth inn it
Aye

I know
Er
She's is his cousin

She's his cousin
'Cos I says to her one day well why don't you ask yer your relation if he'll er if he'll give yer a job
Give us a job she said he won't even pass the time of day with us
I said well I there must be sum mat there out there she said no he said she said it goes back a long time
But er she says never even speaks to us
And if we if if we ring up he puts he just puts the phone straight down soon as you tell him who it is
Probably goes back from when they went
He said I she said I can live without him anyhow
It'll drop off that
It won't
It will
Come on yella
I found some Mighty Muscle in garage you know
How much
You know that big round tin
I not how much is in it but it'll probably be about that much in bottom
I know wanting to do this room really 'cos it would be too cold
Get away with one
I wish we'd just too cold
You won't as far as we're having to buy coal at that price
No I know
Every time we have any spare money it has to go on pig g ing coal
how much
You know that big round tin
Yeah
I don't know how much is in it but probably be about that much in bottom
might be really couldn't too cold
Get away with one
I wish we'd afford some I mean it's cold
You won't while we're having the buy coal at that price
No I know
Every time we have any spare money it has to go on pig g ing coal
We'll probably just buy some and that lad 'll ring up
He probably will
Especially if this mild weather stops
But it is mild today ain't it
Yeah
That's not a moo cow
Get down
It is
It is
It isn't
Moo o
That's it
That's what moo cows do
You're crackers
It is
It is a moo cow
I mean like er Eileen was saying sum mat yesterday she said she said I don't er have at home she said I decided to I said I'm frightened and sometimes knows I'm not frightened
I said I'm frightened someone's in the ' o use I'm frightened not waking everybody well well what do you do I says you don't unless you have a go you don't I mean if I'd turned out you know you don't really know
I know
I mean that
You might and then again you might be a millionaire inside three months
Yes I said to her think about it I I was that frightened I frightened me self to death and I I wouldn't I wouldn't
I hated it
That's what I used to do every time I thought about selling ' o use
You just got to do it
Yeah
I thought about it and thought about it and then then changed my mind
But this time I decided it's what I want to do and bugger it
If we don't sell it we we haven't lost anything
Oh well
sell it till we move
I honestly think myself
As long as we're not worse off than what we were before we moved
I honestly think me self that I might have a have a couple of hard months maybe three first three months might be a bit difficult for me
Oh it probably will be
Well I think once he gets established and once he starts getting work in I think me self that work will start won't say rolling in but I think the work 'll start coming in after about three months and I can get established
Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten pence s
I know
I know we're hard up but you can ten pence
You never know might be to make enough money to take you out somewhere for a decent Christmas do
Oh
Yeah Christmas party
Yeah
Yeah might
You might
want to come work for him did I tell ya
Who
Him that used to work with our Colin
Yeah
You know er well
Aye the
I the would
It's gotta be better than being on do le inn it
No I don't know
Oh is that
No he's no he's got a good job
He works at with plenty of overtime
Ben j y
Colin phoned him up and er it it he mentioned how he was starting up and he said he might be interested anyway Colin phoned him a couple of weeks ago to see if he was still interested in
Anyway he says he'd pay him the same money as what he's on there 'cos he'd have to really wouldn't just say say
You've you've got to but how the hell get it if he don't get paid up front
What do ya mean
Well wages
Got to
Well it have to come out of capital at first
Yeah
put by ten or eleven thousand or whatever it is just come out of that
Yeah
Yeah
So we got money coming in
Mm
our Karen
But er I mean I says can't we manage without him can't you manage by yourself but Colin says he can't really because
He needs somebody
Yeah
Well Colin 's gotta be able to do a lot of office workhe's gonna be out doing quotes you know what I mean so he's going have to have somebody there
Yeah
Yeah
Or I would apply for er family credit straight away
get coming in I'm gonna say yeah we've got ten thousand pounds
But we don't know how long it'll be before get any money coming in and if you go on to family credit you get it for six months so that'll be our wages
So then what what comes out of business we'll pay him anyway
Yeah
You might have too much in bank for family credit that ten thousand it's only eight inn it
It's got it's gotta know what increase when you running a business
Yeah
Oh I don't know
If you apply for it straight away could you say you don't know how much monies coming in
How much money your gonna coming in
His dad's in a new business anyway be c so you should get forty quid a week at least anyway
Thirty - f i v e now
Is it thirty - f i v e
Yeah
Bloody hell
Yeah
It's like everything else
I mean that's seventy pound you wouldn't have had anyway ain't it
No
Oh
I ju I mean it now it's just getting me more depressed than nowt else I mean I just wish that they'd phone and say yeah we've got you a insured
And then I mean 'cos we daren't say that to accountant know to have ' o use valued 'cos what's point in I mean anybody said to user get it sent off you'll find you're somebody will in sure ya
But what if they don't
You've lost all your ain't ya
Ya so that's the end of the world
Even if you find out they won't
No
Why don't you get a free put on market
No the on the company's that's coming up with all the money got to
Oh aye
do the val u at i on
And they ought to form value of what so they know how much it's worth what the company that's gonna earn them the money want the money for the val u at i on
It's just another way of making a bit more money out it
That's it
Well it's same as when you buying and selling ' o uses
You when it comes out when the people that's mind me cigarette darling the people that's gonna buy your ' o use who mortgage company comes out and values it they've got that to pay as well haven't they
Yeah
The same as I them that buys our ' o use they'll have to pay whatever it cost for 'em to value our ' o use see if it's worth lending money we'll have the same thing with er bungalow down there
Yeah
It's only money I mean how long are they 'er e
Yeah
Ten minutes
Mean that woman come out when when we had this done didn't she
Mm
To to see if it were sat is fac she weren't here three minutes
No
What was that for for
You know when we had extension put up
Oh yeah yeah
Well
Did it value
They sent they sent 'em out from er Abbe y National and we had to pay well we did pay 'im fifty pound people that put the building on paid
she keeps getting up
She's not
She is
She'll bite you and our Whisky can
She scratched him outside didn't she
And if she were here three and a half minutes that's all she were 'er e and it and it 'em fifty quid
Yeah
Bloody ridiculous
It's all a bloody money making racket
Another thing is I'll tell why we don't want er they always having val u a tions they are they come and value it and then they give us money
That means we're gonna be paying extra eleven thousand with money we ain't got
Yeah
That's another reason we're daren't send it off
Yeah
Yeah because if ya if ya get it before ya start your business
You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it
Yeah
Trust them because it's in their at the moment
Well I still believe in and I don't pushed around and say no you can't have money no you can't get insured and so that means others
You haven't lost anything have ya
Well just er disappointment I suppose
For what
Well yeah
Then again I mean I
There's always sum mat else you can go and do
You know that doing that fabric a ting and things like that you know like actual weld ing and that type of Er we wouldn't make as much money out of that as you probably would
No
No you'll be you'll be stuck to it all time and it's not good for 'im
No
And it kills your eyes weld ing
Ben j y
But as he said to me why don't you go weld ing
I says the point is I've got bad eyes as it is
Yeah
what's the point in making them worse
I know
So jump in me boxand I ain't jumping in me box blind for the last ten years
I'll manage the way I am
You see that works where I
Ben j y
Aye
Ben j y look at 'im
Ben j y
Where are you when it's gonna be he said corner then we'll make an office and a little can teen in that anyway
Then there's another long unit right at side of it just enough to get one trailer in
I said I said if we do get going and we do start finding out that it's going alright he'll turn that into like er shop er blasting shop
And like
Yeah
A spray are a then
Yeah
Employ a spray er
So I mean we know what we want but it's them and not us I mean it is frightening to start a business up 'cos we don't know how much work we'll be getting but I mean
Well it's same for anybody starting any business ain't it you don't know if it's gonna work as well
It might go well for the first three or four monthsand then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months
Yeah
you could be struggling to keep it above
Yeah
and especially you know these bloody big firms they do not like paying bloody bills
No
I mean you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya but your business will still go under
Yeah because of it
Because of it
Yeah
They don't look on them things how much you've got owed out to ya
I know
When you look you see everything's a bloody risk
Let's hope he gets off the floor
walking across roads a risk ain't it
Yeah
It's ju just if you've got the nerve to do it
It's a risk with these bugger s what's in power aye it's no matter what whose in power
I got
I think if labour gets in you'll not get it tough at all
I can tell you that now
O ohh
What
O ohh
You feel like er that's whose like ex soldiers throughout the company and he said to Colin er he said how many people are you thinking about employ our Colin seems to think there'd be enough work to keep 'im going like he say she says well how many people are you thinking about employing he says only only me and me like it's ohoh he says there's plenty of work to keep two of going he said I thought you employed about six
So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him and he's got enough work for six then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two of 'em
Yeahbut what he means by six i she gets the jobs done quicker
Yeahbut then you still got six wages to pay out haven't ya
Yeah
That's it
He probably will have six later on if he gets it off but the thing is I mean he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard and half the time y you know he'll be sat doing nothing scratching his nose
Them's the people he's got to be wary of the people that want a job but don't wanna work for it
There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stain ford
Yeah
round about here
Mind Lee's a Lee's a good worker he says that he wants you know best worker what he can
Yeahbut I mean working for a mate is different to working for a firm
Yeah
You know I mean
Wellhe's not a mate he won't he's working with him when he were at er over in Brad oh here's Richard now
Aye you'd better jump in bed with him
Oh dear no but he is Richard is the one with the comical magazine laughing bursts two in comes

exactly older than me
First and twenty - f i r s t
You want to do what she's doing now
Who's it for
Oh
I thought it was that wife
Oh Norma
Oh no
Oh no not 'er
Norma
Pack one her
I know I call that but I mean I don't down the town but her
But I I didn't think I like that
Mum mum watch this are you watching
You have to lose a race now and again
Yeahbut she ain't even
Are you watching
er what was was I saying the I don't know what George has all the customers I mean she's isn't even particularly
isn't she she's not what you call really bon ny she ain't got a right bon ny face
I know she's got a nice figure
She's as thick as two short planks she's got a dirty mouth
I mean I you know maybe
I can't understand your cross
I know
Cannot understand or something
Their as different as chalk and bloody cheese
Plenty of different people cheaper the other people who have different likes to you but what what you might think's att r ac attractive somebody else 'll
Yeah
won't be you know
To be quite honest without talking like a school on a fence
They're not very happy they ain't been happy for a while but it's getting worse wh is what is them now is you know I say things to Colin and Co I mean Colin 'll tell me like you know you know over there and er he's latest thing is they built this little office
You know when you go into on the right er a coal - h o u s e and a wash - house ain't there
Yeah
The coal - h o u s e part it's is quite wide now we've done it big coal - h o u s e b u t altered
And then it twists and like a small office and when when I were there after Michael had shown it me and Colin he says oh he says er I'm come in here to get get out of way and you know he was like telling me I thought I don't want to be a fiddle because it's alright telling Colin the boys
telling yeah
Yeah
ain't it yeah it's not like a woman telling you problems
Don't knock my dusters off
Anyway I just said wells umm at about about what I said I says yeah nice to get away from it all ain't it to be by yourself and that's all I said and I think he knew that I I didn't want to
but and he said to Colin
oh shit
said he said yeah he said it'll be ideal in here he said I can put he said put a full lock on door and he said I can come in here he said and so I thought ah
Yeah but there's not many people that you can
Sa sha be have
I don't think I know anybody that hundred per cent ' appy
Well I think it's got a lot to do with the climate we're living in you know
Rushing about
There's that much there's that many people out of work there's and
you know there's that many pressures on people
I mean it's like like Colin and I I mean like we're happy but then no were not hundred per cent happy at all But like er like some people I can't if you get upset some people eat more some people eat less or you know some go into recluse some get and like Colin
he's when he's depressed he's goes like a raving sex mania he
I'm bloody glad Albert don't he'll drive me out of a bed
He takes all takes all his
Why didn't you stop
No I think every
I think everybody's got themselves sum mat some fault s
Nobody's hundred per cent perfect
I mean I don't think Colin 's unhappy where he wants to do then an offers an offer like either they go in and make share but if they work all day
No it's not er it's so much I mean he's at work all day and he works all bloody hours that God sent when they want when they got down
Yeah
and what happens
He's got to build an office where he can go and lets it in it can't abide
That's right
Sum mat wrong somewhere
Now look at our Margaret and Peter
They've got no family so they've got no pressures like that they haven't got any money problems well they're not ' appy
They live two entirely separate lives
Yeah I know
There's is just a marriage of er convenience
Convenience
Inn it it
Yeah it's convenient
It's a way of life they've lived together that long like they don't want to
If when you and Pete had that trouble if our Margaret had er been working I honestly think she would have left Pete
I know
But the only thing that our Margaret could come up with was why should I why should I leave me home and sell up she said when all my life he's had money from the house
He'll have the money from the house plus a wage every week
She said and what will I have she said just the money from the house
She said and where do I live
You know he can move back home with his mum she said I suppose I can go back home to me mum well then I've got to look for a job you know
Mm
And I honestly think that was the only reason that she stopped for Pete
Yes
Because she's she he he were gonna get a wage every week
Yeah
You know and she worked all them years and then when she weren't working she have no money coming in every week
Yeahbut she's got all the shares
She hasn't she got rid of them all
Aye not with B l not with
Yeahbut you could see you could see that I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty pound a week
Yeah
We'll he had his money he won't have to touch he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week
Oh aye
And he could start again
Find another woman and buy another house and start again
Mm
I mean like Jeremy and Kay I mean they're not happy
They pretend they are but I mean like he's he's
They've got to do aren't they I mean after all bloody harm they caused
Yeah you know you know how flaming miserable and ma rd y he is
Yeah
He's another one
But you see when he living with An ge maybe he were younger then but I mean like when he were living with An ge he had all the women as you know plus he had Kay plus he had you know An ge he had everything there was Kay as well weren't he now he can't
No
But then again if even Kay over there with she said something about er oh we've been out but I told you I went to a last Monday
Yeah
and she said something about oh we've been to that new pub she said mind she said we had to come home at half past nine she said he'd had enough she said he were ready for bed God she said he's turning into a right old man and you know what I mean she didn't she wouldn't
Exactly
She didn't realise what she was saying as such but I thought and I thought yeah I know
Yeah well he is what ten years
Thirteen you got from 'er
Thirteen years difference
She's how old am I twenty - t w o s o she's twenty - n i n e
Same age as our Kim
Yeah
Oh she'll be coming at thirty this year won't she
You see she's just coming into her prime and now he's he's just leaving it
yeah
He's really forty - t h r e e this year
Don't work
He'll be forty - t h r e e this year and she'll be thirty this year
The only thing time that happens is that is you hear about
Look George
if yo if one's fifty over sixty
He's plucking his feathers out
then it works
But when your younger it or even when you're young you know it does
But when you get into your forties
Well it's like I mean like
It works
I'm me and Colin are settling down a lot compared to what we were five year ago
I mean like like now we were a say even two and three years ago and somebody'd said to me are you going to Spain and I would have said yeah we'll go to Major ca lovely we could stop out all night do what you want
Now only three or four years later I'd say of yeah we're go to somewhere a bit quieter so that kids can go to bed of a night time we could have a apartment
Yeahthat's right yeah
Yeah
And that I'm changing that way but if our kids have to be home with the a group when I went to see Squeeze
And it were a good group I wanted to go see
Our think nowt about going and watching 'em
Johnny won't go anywhere like that
Kay 's wanted to do what we do and Johnny's not interested
Yeah
Like went to fair she went to the riding he
He said that's ya like a big kid going up fair
I mean look at
I mean that's all she is yet she's she's only a bloody
Yeah twenty nine
Well I like to go on rides
I go on rides June won't go on
I know
Yeah wellthat's what I mean
Go on shit
The thing is like he is even apart apart from 'im being a lot older than 'er he acts older
I mean he acts like his always er forty three he acts like he's like fifty sometime well you you're older than you know what I mean he acts older than you because as you say you'll go on fair rides and
Aye
Mind you we're we're getting on
No but you know what I mean I mean
Yeah I know what you mean
Fifty
Fifty - t h r e e
Four
Fifty - t h r e e
Fifty - f o u r
I'm fifty - t h r e e
Your fifty - f o u r next birthday you're only a couple of months off
Well I'm fifty - t h r e e
He's fifty - t h r e e
'Cos you probably do more things
You know younger things than what he does
And he gotta
Yeah
He should be keeping himself young for 'er
Mm
Instead of 'er keeping him young she's he's making her old
That's it yeah
I think Chris on about moving to blink ing Gains borough now
Gains borough
Colin were telling me today
Yeah
He said they've had twelve ' o uses them since they've been married
God
I were talking to him on Friday and er I mean they've not been down there five minutes
Oh no Road
Yeah
Mind I never been there 'fore oh I can't remember a few years can't re last time I've been there
Mm
Well la last year when you were doing that painting for er Derek
Mum
Wait a minute
Er Derek paid him off
Yeah
and got Johnny to finish it
Mummy
and er I I saw Chris quite a lot then but I mean they're not living how they used to do I mean they they were always boozing and that
Yeah I know
she said they'd they'd cut down on boozing and everything
But er
Give upS a sha
I says to Tommy why don't they buy one of them big car a vans I said because every time they get
Mum
it must be costing them a fortune when every time they move they alter ' o use they decorate and put new carpets down and furniture
My God we'll have to
Yeah well I mean I mean not
Yeah but I mean twelve times Karen
I know
You're saying like us I mean we wouldn't want to move again I mean if we move again it's 'cos something's gonna happen with his business ain't it
Yeah
Yeah
But or because same thing like it were a couple of years ago with finances
I mean how how olds their oldest is it eighteen or seventeen
Is it Mandy whose older
Yeah
I mean I thought M andy's er eighteen nearly nineteen
So
Oh no she must be older because er Vicky's twenty she must be about eighteen
No she's same age a Tree na twenty
So in twenty years they've had twelve ' o uses
Yeah
And you've been married how long
Twelve
Twelve years and you've had three
Three
Christ you better not be married twenty years Karen you might end up with another twelve
I know but how many's your Pete and Margaret have they had er
Er they moved they went on to
One twothree
didn't they
Yeah then t'
Yeah then now they went to aye they went to Oval went to bungalow
yeah some four times
four yeah four or five times yeah
Yeah
Yeah
There's only us who never moved
Oh yeah
Angie how long's me mother been in there
I'm forty - e i g h t this year me mum must have been in there nearly fifty year
And we've only moved into here
In actual fact your Pete and Margaret have moved more in the twelve years that they were married I know they've been married longer now but when th they been married twelve years and they moved four times
Yeah
we've been married twelve years and we've moved three times so we haven't moved as much as them really
No
No
I couldn't keep moving and
I couldn't move like that
I mean a couple of moves is fair enough yeahbut bloody twelve
No
And it's not as if they made money every time they moved 'cos they haven't 'cos they lost money on that ' o use there
Yes
I won't it
Well Chris said they moved because er
Give up
er transport you know
It would be difficult for 'er to get back' ar ds and for'a rd sand she were on her own all the time
Yeah
That's why they moved
But they moved down they moved from 'er e because he says er
Too noisy weren't it
Too too noisy and dogs were keeping them up all night
Oh
So I don't what the excuse is for moving from Road
Same thing 'cos it's noisy down there
Yeah
I could scare you Auntie June
Could ya
Yeah
Go on then
Why people think it's noisy for us on a double main road but it ain't really
Well you get used it in don't ya
When our Norma come and stop here she she was
Used to sleep
I don't know how you sleep all night with all that traffic going up and down
No
But we never hear it
You don't hear it
No we didn't
I remember one first night we stopped there buses were coming at crack of dawn
Yeah
it must have been about four or five o'clock in morning and now we never hear any traffic
No
No
Perhaps you get used to
Yeah
But we don't hear many people on a road like that
No
I were thinking about that bungalow and well actually it's as far from our road nearly as far from our road to there as what is it from bungalow window to road
Where to yeah
it really is
Know thinking about people walking back as far as t' shopping my point
There nowt much difference in from t' garden
I think the only trouble over there is your to gonna have people parking in front of ya gate like when they go to the chip shop
They won't
Yeah
They won't 'cos 'cos er I'm afraid if they do I shall be out straight away at 'em
Well it's only a matter of parking at parking your own car as well
I'll clamp the bugger I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it
Park here at your risk
It'll be awkward getting cars in and out when you know with one more to be out and all these cars in road like but
That's the only difficulty
You'll probably end up say leaving one on road all night
Yeah
Don't hurt I mean
Oh not leaving one on bloody road
Well we could put 'em at night time it's just through time if one backs in comes in behind other
Yeah
It's a one way street and all ain't it that makes it worse
Why does it make it worse
Well we don't have to have a problem do we
No but I mean
It's like barbed wire I mean that's Sa sha come in 'er e
What backs on to that bungalow Karen
Another ' o use
Another ' o use
Another ' o use
Er I told you what backs on to it you know the right small on what you were going to see that time but on the side
Yeah
We went to see that
Oh
That's what backs on to it
Oh
well at least they won't be looking in t' bungalow will they with it all being down
No
and that
Yeahthat's straight behind it
Oh
Not like them I mean they can see straight into our
I'm not sure but I think it was Mr that had that bungalow built
You know Mr
Yeah
Somebody told me that he had that built
Oh
Years ago before he had that ' o use built on Road
Oh
What you doing with the a cup of tea
Sa sha
She's there
She's there
Come 'er e
Georgie babes
Them can be about I mean that's what it probably is
That's what it is
Dust yeah
Oh
It's not so much now it's so much that
It's not his feathers it's dust
when he
when he does that and he flaps the dust off his body
Oh
You know like they're always picking their feathers
Yeah
Well they have right tiny little scales coming off their feathers
Oh
for the feathers to open out like it's like wax
Wax
Ohyeah li like like birds have
Yeah like birds have
Yeah like what they have on the crest
Yeah yeah
Wellthat's that's what they're doing
The problem is it's dry
They're pulling it off and when he's shed he all floated
Is that what causes that parrot to
Yeah
Yeah
To er what call it
Yeah
We were
No
Took us an age to cut it
on there
Yeah
Oh or sum mat daft like that they call it
but it's like sum it's like some people of being allergic to different things you know
No he wants to stay out he pulls his feathers out when he's in cage
How do you off feathers and not off birds
You do you get it off any bird
Yeah but some are not not so much 'im 'cos he don't shed his feathers as much as 'im
'e' s not half 'e' s not half as dirty as 'im
I mean you only have to look at top of that cupboard and it were don't yesterday
Yeah
That's what I say
Every where's white everywhere white

Having house full of kids and being on do le

And Sierra 's are if something jerks it cuts the fuel line dunn it
Mm
It stops it and you've got a button somewhere on your dash what you press to release it
Well they didn't know and they to it were towing Julie's car and the tow belt snapped and of course when it jerked this car forward it cut the petrol off
Or what
Shouldn't have done
Well it did
And he couldn't get no petrol for it and he had to call A A out
So she had to walk home and he walked home
It shouldn't have done that
Not on not when they're when they're already in motion
Set off with the towing Julie's car and the tow rope just snapped in two and it jerked both cars and it cut off the fuel
Well he should have just zoom ed off
It shouldn't have jerked his should it
Yeahbut you've got your feet down and you're towing sum mat and then suddenly it releases it just goes er forward a bit dunn it
See that bit in
That doesn't
paper about that Robin Reliant and he's done it all up and it does hundred mile an hour
Hundred and eight
I wouldn't fancy going down no bloody motor way hundred eight in one of them
I tell you some of them Rob i
I bet I bet it's
I know

Ohoh dear
I shouldn't think anybody'd in sure it
I'm surprised
Then that bloody pr at towing down motor way at hundred mile an hour

Have you seen
Well Terry came down last night
Well
Will you have any exams this year
Got loads
I've got about twelve
For what
Everything
I've got I've got one in March for definite
What exams
Yeah
I don't know
I think I've got one in April
You don't pay for them though do you
I hope not
Ah
I hope not and all
I have one in April two in May
And what are they all on like
three in June or two in June and then when we go back we've got about three in September
and we'll have some more at Christmas
They're not mock exams are they
No
Proper exams
I've got my Red Cross in stage one my R S A part one and two stage two
I've got shorthand Pit man not Pit man R S A shorthand Tee line shorthand Tee line again at end of one end of year
And I've got another one in word processing hopefully
I've got my audio
My audio o transcript i on medical and I've got my Tee line medical
Oh
M hm
And then after that I've got er that thing in for my exams
My proper diploma exams
None of themthere's only two of them that are to do with my diploma
All the rest are at fortunately
How long will you finish this
Middle of next year or end of next year
It'll be July when we take the exams
That's when the course will actually finish
What this July
No
No
That's right
But I don't know how long it is before I get my results back
But you can get a post as a medical secretary in a hospital or a G P without having your full diploma
If yous let it cos to get the full diploma you've got to get your two skills which is medical audio and medical shorthand you've got to have them two skills to get the diploma
And you've also got four papers ethics and etiquette you got an English one a medical aspects one and a cl eric al skills one
Not a cl eric al skills one but office procedures
And you've got to pass all them plus your two skills to get the diploma
But you can res it any what you fail the following year
Mm
Mm
Teresa says the only one what presents any difficulty is usually the medical aspects one
Well why should that present anything different
Because it covers such a wide are a
It says the English paper you only need you only need seventy five percent for your er m it's seventy five percent pass rate
You've got to get above seventy five to pass
Yeah it's
That's quite high that you know seventy five percent
Well it's got to be ain't it
The office procedures she said is simple anyway and yet ethics and etiquette is a she said and your teacher works you that hard and it just drill s in anyway
No but seventy five percent is a high pass rate
Well I don't know who she is that sends letters out to your nana but she's bloody useless
She misses more words out than she gets in
And she just writes over them in in pen
If it's her computer though they might just er m thingy it and change it to suit them
Well it wouldn't be on word processor
You don't know
Cos it's the you're supposed to that's what it's for so you can check all your spelling s
A lot of them letters that come out are already done and you just delete
Gonna say that's they're all on word processor that's what I'm saying
Eh
I got a pass oh I got a distinction for we did er like mock exam for word processing I got a pass
Whatsername
her in her the launder ette were asking me er she was she were on about I ain't you got a job yet
I said I think I'm too qualified to get a job
She said we she said well aye you might be
She says int your daughter i er a nice girl
I said well aye sometimes

She's seen you in there
She says what's sh what's she do
I said oh she's at college
Oh
Really
I says she says er what she's studying
I said well she's er she's going in for medical secretary
She said well where does she get her brains from
I sa I said well who do you think
I says I'm over - qualified for work I says and it looks like she's gonna end up that way if you're not careful
She says oh
So she said I think she's ever so pretty
I says aye
Said pity her manners don't blink er manner is ms don't match her looks
Teresa's on about er m a she were asking me if anybody'd be interested into going on to higher er education after this
And I
college yet
Yeahbut you get you don't get no grant for that
What college
But if it's only a part - t i m e so you can actually work part - t i m e that's the difference
Yeah
Fantastic salary if you get qualified
It's alright if you can get day release from your
work to do it
That's what you want to be after day release
Yeah
They're trying to make our course into a three day a week
Er m nine till six at night
It's a long day though
That's what I said
I mean
you get we get a mental block after three three o'clock us
You do
I mean doing shorthand for four hours a day it's too much
It's far too much
Well just think when you're working full - t i m e you'd be working nine till five
I know but it's different when you're concentrating
Mind you
on studying and when you're concentrating on working
Billy er Billy 's one of Billy 's daughter - i n - l a w s s h e s h e does it part - t i m e
What medical secretary
Yeah
She's er
Good money at part - t i m e
I know
That's what er m that's which one of them who were it telling me
Er I don't know whether it were the young lad that comes in or whether it was Jes that were telling me
M hm
I can't imagine it being Jes
I think it were Jes what were telling you
Well it might have been Jes cos I don't know tha well they've got I think they've got two children
And she were doing it full - t i m e and then she went she had children and then she went part - t i m e
But I don't think she's working
That's one advantage of being medical secretary
I think she's just had another baby or sum mat
cos if you get in a big organization like N H S they provide a c rec he
Mm
And th i I mean you don't have to pay for the c rec he cos it comes in the it's part of your
Well
thingy
part of your job inn it
It's like nurses at hospital inn it
And they've got a hospital
Mm
Well that's the c rec he what you get into

That's why a lot of people will go into medical secretary who have children
Has Sue got a job at all
I don't know
She's not interested
No
I think she'll be married shortly
I can see her marrying him
Yeah
But he's one of them lads where she'll never have ow t cos he don't do he won't bloody work will he

As soon as he gets a house she will leave home
Yeah
He's not so sure of that
What's happened between other one
Have they had an argument like
No
I just don't know
She's got two men
I know but always nice to know
Bit of scandal now and again
You're getting worse than a woman you now you're at home
I know there's nowt from men though is there
They say women are bitchy but have you ever heard a conversation bet we
No
conducted by men
They beat us easy
That back door wants rubbing down I think don't it before you paint it dunn it

By putting
Put them in the wrong places ain't he
I mean what he's do I I know why he's done it
They didn't what he's done he's thought well I'll just do that and incorporate the sink in it
Yeahbut fancy putting sink up in corner like that
Well
They can't put a work top along that wall under window cos it cuts the unit off
If it'd been me and I were gonna put it there I would have put a window there to look out of
Or a door there
Yeah I know
Well I can't understand why he wanted to move the sink from where it were
No I can't
I think it was in a lovely position
They could have had cup boards right round there rate along there if they'd left
Rate

Th th the cheapest one like
Aha

You have to keep chasing that

one's a dry unit and one's a wet unit
You're supposed to use bag in that when you do it like but
What paper bags
Yeah
Yeah you know you know when you put your filter
When you're drying
in you're supposed to be a bag in first and then your filter
But when you put your filter in it won't run because by time your bag's filling up it's pushing your filter in
That's what this one's like
But then
Until we get the bags
What you mean
It's a
Come in here
I'll show you
When you're do it dry

cos she wanted it on sixty weeks
Ooh oh

Mm
anyway their Be v 's husband he'd been doing some work plus some money they dropped on these spin d les so she was telling me
Mm
cheap and that
Mm
and then she got a join er in to do it but you know that
He's a welder int he Be v 's husband
Well he's

Is he
Mm and er
Gone contract to somebody I think
she did oh she was sending money and dad's been down there and the money ain't been paid into bank though
She's a lovely girl Be v int she
Yeah but she
You can't you can't really get be mad with her cos she's so nice she never er never nasty with you is she
No it's
Ever so nice it's just
Yeah
that she just gets a
I mean she
she does
she got electric bill two hundred and odd pounds
Oh God
she were crying and doing you know what I mean
Yeah
And er but I mean you've got to watch your bills if you haven't got much money coming in Joyce ain't you
Well you watch your bills if you have don't you really
Yeah
I mean you don't go mad at it do you
I mean look at what's
No
costing us lately we're having to get these I mean we have that on two in the morning to get this room warmed up don't we have to put it down to one
Yeah Joyce has turned it down to one
Yeah
and er then it's costing er three bags of coal every week
Yeah
while this cold weather's on
Yeah
fourteen pound twenty five a week
Yeah it's a lot of money
Yeah
and then that every
I know
two or three weeks
it's a lot of money
It's a lot of battle
keep using much stuff we've got now hmm you know we do well with that stuff too
Well just oh what we had stuff
yeah
I know Pauline was saying she's had to buy some coal
that's it
They do on the day fourteen bags for four ninety eight cos I were in
Mm
and she's had to go and buy some that had gone and I says well I she says it's just burning it up that fire
Yeah
I said it's a great big g rate
Yeah
I says well I actually put a couple of bricks at side
We've got a couple of bricks in ours
I says it'll throw same heat out
Yeah
and you'll not need all that
But we have a couple of bricks in
Couple of half bricks
Half bricks
Mm
so the fire can still get me warm
Yeah
get up you'll still get your
Yeah
er m there's holes or sum mat at side for er central heating
Ohoh cold
Mm
oh that's that must be for burning coke then
What's that love
Holes are your sholes the same
Yes she's got holes the same she burning
I agree
yet it'll be suitable for coke they said
Yeah knowing she she'll probably be put in for planning then for coke
Oh she's got central heating like you know what I mean er m she's not really into them now I think
how she's got a cheeks he just gets what she wants don't she
She just takes charge
And then
I've never heard anybody like her
No
and she gets away with it don't she
cos he says er her husband is
She's always
she took it on six year he says seven to eighty so she looks like working for next six year
then you know when I go she's pleading poverty she'll say
Bet she'll go and buy it
Yeah
Mm
but er they've still had a a lot of money put to it their selves
I see
because you see all this bloody expensive A ga they won't be
towards that council I mean like she's gonna have it tough again you know what I mean
She always does doesn't matter what she gets it's got to be different to anybody else's and
Yeahyeahyeah

Yeah she'sshe's alright she's alright but she's
you just feel like er saying look Annie go steady don't you you know what I mean

She could shouldn't let her have all that
No we could do that
Yes
couldn't we
Of course we could yeah anybody could
Anybody could go and get all this stuff and then not pay
Not pay for it yeah that's right

How quaint can one be
They all wore Peter Pan collars and thought cleavage was something butchers did we were before vitamin vitamin pills disposal diapers Q E one jeep s pizzas instant coffee and Kentucky Fried wasn't even thought of in our day cigarette smoking was fashionable grass was for mowing pot was something you cooked in
A gay par person was the life of the party and nothing more

Space Man
Sunday night
Come on Grant
It was Sunday night and Scott was watching Space Man on television
Scott had watched him get into the rocket many times and he dreamed about going with Space Man
It would be fun if I could get into the that rocket too thought Scott
It would be fun to go far out into space
That was the one thing
Full stop
Scott thought about
He was fast asleep before Space Man had finished his trip
Scott began to dream
Good
The time had come for Space Man Scott to go to the moon
He would be the first boy to land on the moon
Scott walked outside and looked up at the rocket
The rocket was as tall as seven houses
It was as tall as seven houses
This rocket was this Scott said that that would take him to the moon
Scott climbed inside the rocket
The men were getting ready for blast off
Ten nine eight seven sixfive four threetwo one
Blast off
Space Man Scott be began has
His
his trip to the moon
On and on into space went Scott Seven
Then a part of the rocket fell away
When Scott looked out he could see the stars and many flashing lights
Part of the time Scott talked on the rocket 's radio
Part of the time he just looked out into space
The rocket came to a stop at Space Station
Some works at the station
Some workers
some workers at the station took Scott inside
New line
They asked him
they asked him to remember all the things he could about the trip from earth
Then the men talked about other rocket
About the other
about the other rocket would take him
That would take him
on to the moon
They helped Scott get ready
In the morning Scott three other men got into the moon rocket
Again he were ready to go
Ten nine eight seven sixfive four threetwo one
Blast off
Away went the rocket with Scott and his friends inside
Away it went on its long trip to the moon
As last
At
it at last they landed on the moon
Scott and the men got out and looked around
What a strange place it was
Look herelook here Scott said one men
Man
one ma one said one man
Do you see that big brown thing that looks a boat
You live on that boat
That's the earth
That's what your home looks like from up here on the moon
How strange it was fro for Scott to see
That
His
his home was a round planet far out in space
One man had a shovel
He wanted to take some things from the moon back to earth with him
The other men looked around and talked on the radio
Scott followed the men
He was not looking where he was going
He was he was looking
Yeah okay sorry you're right
he was not looking where he was going where he was going
And
and he fell down
Down down down Scott fell
The dream was over and so was Scott's trip to the moon
Well said his mother what are you doing down there on the floor
Scott laughed I just fell off the moon
He said what a dream I had
Very good

Cos Grant's got lots and lots of books and quite a lot now but she loves books and she takes care of them as well
Look
A Son of a White Horse that your book from France mummy bought you
Daily Express today
She loves books
It's the same
it's the same thing today

Let's have
young gifted and demanding it says
Her have said and she went along Bobby and they found her so brilliant
Is that the same one
That's her
Er m she
She can use a computer
yes that's right
she enjoys
and her mummy was so sweet
The little boy looks like his mummy
Catherine
Tells you things she should she should be able to read when she's three or something
Jodie oh that's Jodie Bobby
Right have you starting to talk early and with a wide coverage unusual it is for their age example classical music for a three year old reading by the age of three early ability and enjoyment of
real curiosity about how things work
Mm mm
not just to repeat the question why
Logical ability prof ic i ent in chess good at puzzles or special toys such as Le go
That's your favourite Le go
You like Le go
She loves Le go and she especially like
Le go
Where's your Le go
But to make them that Bobby for her teeny weeny hands how she can man u manipulate
The Grant's Le go the big
Yes
Le go she can handle them beautifully even Sheila
Lost a Le go
when Sheila was here last week and Linda and Linda's little boy Christopher and he's only about a month younger than Anna bel and er m she feels the bits would be too tiny for him
He would eat them
Cos one day we found him and he was choking to death practically and er m er T am Linda's husband turned him upside down and smacked his back he'd eaten a one pound coin
B limey
Now he could've choked and died
Heyyou're damaging that Anna bel
So the last time remember
Don't do that to it
remember the last time Linda was here she came on her own and her father
Okay okay
dropped her and then her husband picked her up and the Reverend
the Reverend Peter came that day
Yeah
And er m well he came to the door and Linda and the little the little boy Christopher they were upstairs
But previous to that Linda had said that she was terrified to get Le go for the little boy
She was terrified when him and Anna bel was playing it
I said she's okay and she can handle it beautifully and she's never eaten any little parts yet and some of the arms Bobby are tiny
So she thought well she saw Anna bel handle it so beautifully she thought she might get some for Christopher for his Christmas
But obviously she hasn't got them because er m she would have said when she was here last week
She last week
But
Be a singer sing a song
Bobby and it's to move their fingers and to use their imagination with pictures
It's good for them
It it is it's so good for them

So there'll be six people
So they've got to book the flight but they might book it nearer the time when hopefully they'll get a cheaper flight

He said I on the back at least
Mm
Still there you are glad somebody making some profit just shows what we do buy don't we
I tell you I couldn't get going at all not
I could beat you
He could
Andy
I thought I thought there were gonna be a good ride but
Like Andrew's
He probably got the rough one
Like Andrew
Yeah that was that was similar sort of ride hard bloody work
Yeah
All right up round here ideal up and down the bumps over the guard but when you get it out on the road very hard work similar sort of ride well I suppose it will be run around the you've gotta push around
Alright if you're double fit I suppose and you've got a bit more help to around
Yes
I only took three quarters of an hour to get there
It took about just over half an hour to get back
How's that for straight down Lane straight over lights up hill along the top here
Well it's still not bad at
cold last night far old long trot down from hill inn it
The Bells it's all down hill until you hit all down hill
Yeah
nice and nice but even then they couldn't really
Well I want something in between like the old sports straight down the bike job
Well is he gonna ride on one man's
Mind probably more comfortable than the base weren't they
I got used to them
I yeah I drove up up there and back like my leg don't ache they ach ed a bit at a time but that you know that bone you get each side of your keep your thumb there you've got that bone underneath there's a bone there you might or the bottom bone that you'll sit on you know when you sit still you get that bone
Tail bone
No the bottom here you've got two you've got two just in there in there you got the bones
P elvis
Might be the bottom of your p elvis in there
Yeah
Bloody hurt it bruises you sit on it and it doesn't I thought I might I suppose after a while you'll get blister s but it's bruised when you sit on the bloody thing
And they sit
To get a softer saddle you might get other problems
You might get other problems
You get sore bones sitting down on anything
Oh can do yeahyeahyeah
Especially for me
Yeah oh c r i key yeah
They all ride back
I thought we're gonna so we came out of Paul's place behind Bel mon t Parade up past the ponds there and that's and I'm knack e red I'm going up river had no you start at the bottom of Bel mon t Parade up those ponds up to the traffic lights where you change buses that's all up hill and it's slow and you've just started and you're not warm and it's like running out of here running up that hill there now you could run up that hill if you got if you had sort of round a couple of times round nice no one so more ready to go you'd run up there you come out of here run down here not warm feel you get well I come out of there and and you get you go up past that set of traffic lights you go up and you're still struggling past The Bull that's still up hill you get to the just round that bend and it starts dropping down and it's a gradual drop down below the round about and the next round about 's pretty level there not too bad a round about right the way across to S ca des Hill went down S ca des Hill right the way down to Al ton bottom of Al ton high street came out by the toilets at White H art to High Street up to house
M hm
That's a bit of a drag
Yeah
That's a bit of a long drag that one not that Paul take open up a bit there and go a bit faster level but that was a bit Well 's done a left up to C hell's Field and that bloody that killed him I bet you know the bit I mean and up over the fields where you go through the fields and fields that was the killer cos and coming back Bell's straight round to got to the bottom Hill wasn't too bad
It's a short sharp you can see it there you get to the top of it get up to your round about we hang a right and the next it's a bit of a drag all the way up you save coming coming the other way it's down hill from just past The Bull until you get to the almost to that junction you turn off the top and you're going up hill just slowly but cor you get up to that our junction she drops down we went straight down through the High Street and we hung a right in the one way system turn left didn't get quite get to Green Lane turn left and up we come round the Green Lane up and in the back way
Mm
I say it took us three quarters of an hour to get there three quarters of an hour to get there just over the half an hour getting back
Mind you got short that was a killer up round by place
I reckon we got down from The Bells C hell's Field to the bottom of six seven minutes
Might be a bit more than that but er m could of been nine
She said wouldn't get up hill How these blokes go I don't know aren't they
Mm
Mind you it's the bloke in the front keeps don't he
Keep tucked in behind the side always said to you the bloke in the front mate he does all the donkey work picking up drags you round don't it
Whether he punches hole in the wind in the air or not I dunno like cards
Yeah
He does seem eager up behind some long as you get a right distance too far and you get oh they're fighting it again whereas you can get right up
We were thinking of the car a slower car could overtake a by getting up behind you and when you coming out as soon as he comes out
Yeah
he's got to go back again
That's what I thought
But they don't do they
You get or you get two cars of equal speed along straight
Well it's a memento inn it
one get yeah one gets up behind it and can in the back I suppose but they go after they and then you think as soon as you pull out you're gonna get all that yeah he's gonna get all that but they don't do they
They don't
Gotta be a reason for that I suppose
Cos they're going flat out when they're like that it's not like you gonna say like when you go on a like overtake mode when you're like that they are flat out down the straight all you go to get a out
Mm
It's not like
He goes
Yesit's not like he's going he's he's going faster than this geezer he's not he's getting a drag from him then all of a sudden he comes out and he goes faster you think explain a little bit more on the old
I really don't know
same lines but he know he you assume that as soon as you got outside him that bloody draft would come round and push him back and the other bloke would carry on
Yeah
We might have a bit of a winner tonight
Mm pretty quick aren't they
They're first and second
Yep
tend to blow up do they
Man sell tends to break him don't he
Yep
The other bloke tends to run out of road a bit don't he
Aye we
Bit erratic inn it
Yeah he's not a real charge r is he
No
The only thing that I will do that he might do he might keep cos once gets away mate that's he might keep him behind
Mm
Yeah not used to driving behind is he
No
He's always had to keep that bloody thing
Yeah
Ferrari or something
Yeah
How comes you only stayed at the Curry House
Haha no I never
Ha
No I'm actually
Fucking hell
Did you have money
About a fiver
money so I p once off him you know was well got a free curry a free beer
I must say is the heavy way
Yeah where were we doing that
Way down to a
Yes well that
Where do you lot got with last night pissed off
It's not it's people don't understand or something
Y M C A whatever
Y M C A
Makes me
Oh fucking hell
goes er m oh sort of
Best part of breaking up you making up best part of breaking up
Breaking up you best part of breaking up
Breaking up you news on waking up
And you used to funky little r egg a e oh my god singing
Singing
Singing
They all even all the girls that were screaming like yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Getting
They're bloody
Right anybody else
There should be a timetable at sometime
Yeah there is
Eh do
Already Thursday
It's what this Thursday
Next Thursday
Alright
If it's if it's the first Thursday
Eh right if you've got one of the the two plus three have we have we all got these yeah
Yeah have we got these
These complex questions
The one where that one number eight and it's it's got that complex number that's the one we looked at just before the end of half term yeah
Where you got number so what you do is you multiply by the complex con jug ate top and bottom if we do that it comes out out of multiple of one
I think it's a is it
Yeah it is
Oh
Oh it is
Yeah half
It's a half now if it's a half of that
And then the second says show that that complex numbered to the power of four where that complex number is that complex number so all you do is that four that and then you get minus a corner
Yes so that's the answers
So the two answers are land and the answer is minus a quarter I'll pin that one on the board
Right the second one now I'm gonna do is the one that's equals three plus four yeah and you have gotta write down in the form P plus Q I so it's the real bit plus the imaginary bit one over Z.
One over Z is one over three plus four I's I think we'll do that
How do we go to the the form a number plus times it by the con vex con jug ate is sub three minus four I three minus four I and what we get is three minus four I over twenty five eh that sound reasonable to three twenty fifths minus four twenty fifths high and that's Q I and one over Z square or the second bit several ways to do this what you can do is work out what the square is first so if I do a little aside Z square it's three plus four I square which is nine plus three forty five twenty four I plus sixteen I square which is twenty four I divide seven who's that so one over Z square is one over minus seven plus twenty four I
Multiply by the complex you get again and work the Z square that's pretty hard to multiply MI square minus one do that by changing the imaginary and multiply by then you get an answer
You could square that you could square that complex number right if that's because one over Z is square one over Zone over squared
Yeah problems cos
once you've got one over Z squared if I work it out you get minus seven minus twenty four I overten sevens er m oh so you get
forty nine on the bottom is that
No no not forty nine
That's not forty nine it's er m that's twenty four which is seven twenty four twenty five twenty six six hundred and twenty five
What's that
So we get minus seven of six twofive minus twenty four I over six twofive
Right that's the the complex number one over Z square that's the answer
Right you're you're happy about how I got that
Yes
Yes
Yes
a bit louder a just seven square minus seven minus seven gives me plus forty nine yeah
Yeah
The minus seven times that we could be
plus something and an seven times that one would give you minus pass on to that then twenty four times twenty four is five hundred and seventy six I square for it's minus I square minus formula cos then when I add to add I get six hundred and twenty five it's just it's one you know like the threefour five triangle in P y tha go ras yeah you know when you get threefour five and you can make them three squared four squared so is five squared right well seven twenty four twenty five is another one of those right that's how I knew seven twenty four I knew is six hundred and twenty five that's how I that's how I knew it's
Anyway we get these complex done and you can check that and that fits the right and then the second part of the question t is find the argument Well the argument remember what the argument is
It's time by the minus one which bit's on top
The imaginary bit's on top so I've got twenty four over six twofive divide by seven to go over six twofive
Eh have you got fractions like that
Something over six hundred and twenty five divided by something over six hundred and twenty five now that is exactly the same as just a twenty four over seven cos the six twenty five will cancel out
If I do twenty four divide by seven in verse time I'll get an
Well now what's the anybody got a cal cu la tor with them
Twenty four divide by seven in verse time got a
Well what sort it out
Twenty four divide by seven it's three point six I mean it's definitely of degrees
one point nine degrees
So we get the one point nine degrees now we've got to interpret that now
Now you remember the really big puzzle on there the imaginary bit goes there and minus seven of something along the route bit and minus twenty four of them so I'm going minus seven six hundred and twenty fifths there minus twenty four seven so the actual lines go like that so the one point nine at that angle so the actual is going to be which is two sixty one point nine
Right then let's that's what we was doing
Now if well certainly there's a lot more complicated things in complex numbers you should all you really done is to this thing about the complex you get them work out some al ge bra you go out and Z square some al ge bra and then you've done the complex with some al ge bra and with the use of plus and minus signs in there it's a little bit tricky but nothing that that at A level that you shouldn't be able to handle right and once you've got that you look for some new just working and the least and deciding what happened when you've actually got
That really I mean that's six marks on the yellow paper at that level that's really six per cent but really it's all that that's that looking at that that is one of the easier questions I would deal out very easy
That's definitely one of the easier questions I would deal out
No all the complex numbers that you get on that on that maths are in similar you should be able to do them that is one of the key questions If you think this is hard wait until we go through go through representing back to equations
Yeah
No worries
Yeah
You'll probably be able to that
yeah probably
Is the the difficult stuff
Right next question is the one where you're given these two complex numbers and you're asked to show the the module s of Z one squared is two times the module s of Z two squared
So all it is is says sure that that's that so what I'm gonna do is say the module s of Z one is the square root of five squared plus one squared so if I want the module s of Z one squared then all I've got is five squared plus one squared cos when I've squared it it gets rid of the square root which is don't you think
No so Z two is the square root of two squared plus three squared so I want Z two square is two square plus three square different in square root so the two times is two times well two square is four plus that that is that
Right next one which is find the argument of Z one times Z two Yeah again a couple of different ways of doing it what you can do is you find the argument of Z one find the argument of Z two and then what what will we do for the answers add them together to get the to arguments to something worth together we add them or we can work out Z one times Z two and then just find a mo du list of that complex number now which way do you want to do it
First way
Go on it's up to you
Go on
John said one
working out a module s you have to find the
Sorry did that one I've got to accept it right find the find
find the is up that way somewhere that's fine that's one argument of that is four over five in verse time
one divided by five in verse time
Three eightone seven
Seventy eh
forty five degrees
One divided by five have you ever put one divided by five
Must be less than one five
Yeah we're waiting for a
Good Z two is minus two plus three minus two plus three I
So that's two that's three so three one forty five in verse time what'll we get
One point five in verse time fifty six point three is in there so the answer we want is minus two onethree one twothree seven so add that to and I hear one two four
So that's R Zone Z two that's two R's together and then what I calculate the side B the square root of sixty minus thirty I eh this about the hardest figure that I can do in complex numbers the square root of sixteen minus thirty I
Must n't sixteen minus thirty I but we want the square root of that to begin plus D times
Oops then if I square both sides of that equation then sixteen minus thirty nine equals the A plus B I square yeahthat's just the square on both sides so sixteen minus thirty nine equals square this out under A squared plus two give me plus three squared I squared
Yeahthat's just al ge bra that's just what planners they've got
If I were back at the A squared I squared is minus one so I've got minus three squared there's two give me by I Equals minus thirty nine now because those two complex numbers are the same are the same so sixteen is E S squared minus three square the imaginary grids are also the same so minus thirty equals two eight B.
Don't really imaginary grid on this side imaginary grid on that side from whichif I second one you can see A that A equals minus fifteen over three
There take for two and what are the two cat eg or i es turning to get fifteen over three
No nothing nothing fantastic brilliant yet then substitute all that into the other one so sixteen equals minus fifteen over B squared minus B squared still nothing fantastic eh sixteen equals five square when I get two twofive over three squared minus three squared
Yeahthat's just square
Square root has becomes fifteen squared two plus five B on the boxed squared three square
Get rid of the nobody has any questions
Multiply through sixteen B square equals two twofive minus B to the four cos B squared have B squared multiply B square and I get that
Now bring it all over the left hand side and we'll get B to the plus sixteen B square minus two twofive equals what
That's just bringing that minus B squared bring that to twenty five minus

We came to find out
Yeah
Like you got I mean put the other side of the
Cos what we're going to do now is real what really what this is this is like a quad rat ic equation it is B square squared plus sixty B squared minus two twofive so that's a quad rat ic equation but instead of saying X square I'm saying B square square plus sixteen B square
So what I'm gonna do is use the let's see it's minus three plus I'll minus the square in B square sixteen strand minus four times the eight nine C well I'm gonna do that four times eight nine C equals plus nine all over to A just two
Can't you do the main this way
You can't evaporate it yeah
It vapor is es fairly easy
Well I got
Very very easily vapor is es it but and then when I do that I get minus sixteen plus I minus the square root off one thousand one hundred and fifty six all over two plus minus sixteen plus or minus what's the square root of one thousand one hundred and fifty six
Thirty six is it
I don't know
Thirty four oh thirty four all over two
All over two then if you pass spread them over minus sixteen add thirty four gives me eighteen over two or if I do minus thirty four I get nine over two that'll be plus nine or even minus twenty five
Eh start off with cos you've gone all the way through that
Yeah eh with the end you could have B equals minus fifteen over here and you would have still got the same answer
Now we've got this far so now remember what we're doing we're finding out what B squared is so either B squared is nine or B squared is minus twenty five
Yeah now the none of the things when we get this complex numbers and Bit self is a real number and B itself is a real number right plus B I is actually what we call a complex number if those two apart they're just numbers
So we can't have B square in twenty five twenty five cos nothing exists there twenty five
well we have got complex numbers but we can't have B itself in the complex number right so B square must be nine so either B is plus three or B is minus three one or the two
Now if B is plus three then going back to me formula here is going to be minus five cos if I put the three in it there I get minus five from there
And if B is minus three then here is plus three plus five
so the complex number that is the square root is either two in that pair minus five plus three nine or it is five minus three nine so it's either that one or it's that one and we can write that down very very simply because that one and that one are just the opposite sides but either plus or minus
I suppose
Three five and when you've worked these square roots out they always come out the opposites sides it's always plus or minus always always always
When you work these square root things out whatever square root is it's always one like one plus three minus five the other one's minus three plus five they're always like that
Cos they're what we call complex conjugal s
Do we gets points then sirif the other one was twenty five
Yeah it's just pure coincidence it's just the way that trotting around I think what we're trying to do was to say something wrong in exam book plus plus which is not liked but I don't think they are the a like
Cos they don't actually if you do something like that say you put plus five minus five and then sit down and you're the one that plus three and minus three you don't actually lose marks doing something wrong you cannot be penal is ed for doing it wrong you can only gain credit for doing something right because they'll give you five marks to doing that bit right and then knock three off for doing something else wrong they they would never give you penalty marks they will only credit for doing things right but so often it's quite like down as you want you can't
All that's doing is is the account against this sort of idea that you can always do it
Yeah
Or like people come to you getting forty per cent and forty per cent was of these then the he was was not as good as that one but that one gets the B that one gets the C so you wanna
That's an interesting point that any square root any square root you always get two answers for square roots yeah it's always plus thing and minus thing in complex numbers when you get complex numbers there are always what we call complex con jug at or s if you drew them on them on them dia gram right if you drew them on the dia gram what'll you get plus five minus three I plus five minus three I and then and then we get minus five plus three I You get plus and minus there
Pardon
That's but that is the hardest thing now the hard thing about that is not actual complex numbers it's sort of these equations which is something else you've done equations but the other one haven't really got time the other one complex numbers said what it said to given by that you've got to draw them two on a dia gram that very very slow calculate the module s as Z more minus Z two what work is what Z one minus two is they work in module s
Work out what Z one divided by Z two is and then find the argument of it and give your answer in ratings there
The last little bit it says give your answer in ratings suppose Wright I just suppose W had the seven plus fifteen I how you gonna get R W in ratings
Well one way you can do it is press the ratings button on your cal cu la tor press fifteen divide by seven and then press the ratings button so just do that change it on the ratings one yeah press fifteen divide by seven in
One point one threefour
One point one threefour right one point one threefour right OK do it like that although that doesn't mean anything at all here that's the right answer because you you've in ratings right if you wanted to put it back on degrees ah now press fifteen divide by seven equals and then press in verse
Sixty four point nine
Sixty four point nine well sixty five point nought degrees so sixty five degrees technically right that number is sixty five degrees now one p i is one hundred and eighty p i is the same as one hundred and eighty degrees so if we've got sixty five degrees what we've got is sixty five over a hundred and eighty p i
Sorry
Do that do that on sixty five divide by one hundred and eighty multiply by the p i on your cal cu la tor just one second Robin yeah it's usually it's just theatrical you should get yeah so you get the same answer so you can either work it on ratings or you can write it like that you could've actually left it like that if you come to the third by you put thirteen over what is it eh
Multiple fifteen



My head was going like this on the
He said I'll come up he said if it's more than thirty pound An ge he said you can give me some money next week
Don't worry about it get what you want and I'll fill this for you
Thirty pound
What do you mean why he charging you to do it
Yeah I said cos I couldn't ask him to do for nothing
Yeah well what are you giving him
No I'm giving him a ten ner
I said I'll give you a ten ner to build it all for me
Drill it and do everything
Come with me get the wood measure it the lot
And he said that's alright
So how much you reckon that's gonna be cost then
He said what if you're getting them he got a work top six er m sixty inches
That must be two foot he must mean
And for his kitchen the thick stuff
That's what you want he said the thick stuff
You don't want that thin little stuff like that
He said and that cost me he looked round twenty two pound
Well I said Angie said she went up Wick s ' and got her work tops and it cost her fifteen pound
And he said well Wick s ' are cheaper he said we'll go to Wick s ' then and I'll measure up for it when I come over
What have I gotta take him up
Yeah because Jenny might she might be on a late
If she's on a late
But she's on a early she can come with him and we'll go in her car
Put the roof - r a c k on her car
But if not if if I go up with them and I'd go in with them
Just wait in the car
I'll go in with them and see what I gotta get and just strap it on the roof
And he'll come home and do it he said
What colour are you do well you gotta haven't you
Yeah
as well
So that's what he said it might be a bit more than twenty pound
So he said I said well what if I get the stuff right
Er m I said if there's any money left over I'll give you the money I said and give you the rest the week after or if there's none left I'll give you the ten ner week Oh that's alright don't worry about that he said that's fine
I said alright
Well I want it done properly see and I said you gotta drill and all that
You gotta buy my Christmas present yet mind
Eh
You gotta buy my Christmas present yet
Oh yeah I'll sort that out
Is he better yet then
No
Well then
You could sort me out this week with all that money you've got
I'm getting me kitchen done
And then I'll get Christmas presents
Cos the walls ain't gonna be done I'll get back and get a tub next week and I gotta ten ner left over look to get you something for and get your hat
You'll have to come with me Chris
Because they do it in sizes
Mm
See
See how much it is
What colour are you having the work top
Well I thought cos I like that marble floor ing
If they haven't got any green work tops cos An ge said when she went up there
You'd best price that as well
What
Your floor ing
Yeah
They didn't have any work tops the green An ge said
She can't remember any but there again you were she weren't looking for green
But they've got that marble
You know what we had
Over Jan 's pity we didn't nick that weren't it
They got that sort of marble stuff
The same as the floor so I might pick the green marble
To go with the floor
I don't know yet
Well I really want light green
If they've got it
If they haven't got it well He said if I can always cut it down to size and that
At least it's being done
Mm
Being done and that's one job
So you
out of the way
So you've gone over that wall again
No
I'm doing it tomorrow cos I want to leave it a little bit
Let it dry
Try and make sure it's dried and then I'll do it tomorrow morning when I've been to that play group
You come up with me to pick him up tomorrow
No I ain't going out tomorrow
You won't be here at all
No I ain't gonna I gotta go and have a look round a few second hand shops and that
Oh you're taping
Oh
Oh I got two plugged in at home
That's it
You just I just leaves it on the side
I taped Chris last night like that
You
Yeah cos you gotta London accent
They want your accent
It's your London accent
What are you trying to do
Hello
I put in me bag when I go up the school and I had the little microphone hanging out
We're chatting away and I thought oh you've got to come back and write down who said what
Not who said what but er m
Mm
You know
Yeah
Stop
I want a cup of tea
You just drank all my milk
Yeah
I can't tapes An ge
I need to leave it just hanging there
How many you got
Twenty
But they say you must leave it running for two days
Two days' conversation
Yeah
and that's it
I mean I ain't doing it for a whole week
I'm only gonna do it for two days
Too much inn it
You want a drink do you
Mm
Yeah it's only two days
That ain't too bad is it
I haven't filled one side up yet
I chatting on there
I was chatting all about me units An ge
Ah
gonna make them
Didn't have none up er Attic 's then
No
Well Chris went
He come home with
Three quid An ge
Has it
Yeah you don't Get off the bin
Alright
Yeah you don't use su r names cos no - o n e knows who who anybody is
No
Do you know what I mean
That's right
It don't go broadcasting anywhere it's it's a research team
Yeah
It's good there inn it
And they just pick out certain words that people use and they want different people's different you talk different
Like you know
Oh yeah that's right
Hang on
Ooh
Hang on
Get Sue on there
Yeah yeah
It's quite funny actually when you listen to it
Yeah I know
Bad enough when Pete
you could tape Pete snoring
I already done that
Snoring
This is a new language from
Yeah
Shut up
No you
Ooh a big
Yeah I know
Terrible
he's built it see An ge
Yeah
Leave it to cool
He built it and he put those instead of drawers he put those wire racks in
Yeah they're better
Put those in
Yeah
That's better
So I want it like I want a
Yeah
That'll be nice
So I can take them doors off look and put green ones on
Yeah course you can
Er say fifty quid sixty if that
Well the work top ain't gonna cost that much
It's gonna be the sides and the shelves
I reckon just for this it'll cost you about eighteen quid
That's all
That's all it cost me
Yeah for the top
But then I got the drawers in haven't I
In there and shelves cupboard
Yeah
Yeah but it's only a piece of er m board inn it
Mm
Wood to put on the back
Won't be too bad will it
Mm I'm not san ding that down properly
I'm just doing a quick sh woo o
Yeah
That'll be okay
That one
Oh yeah it's started cracking
That was last night that went
Yeah
Then we gotta put a real stiff coat on there and make it really rip ply
I mean this bit I like
I likes this This is nice
Yeah that's come up really nice that
That's alright I want it like that
Yeah
And up there but I gotta do that again
Yeah
Oh Doreen what she did on her door
Mm
is er m you can buy the strip for the door er m
Strip
What do you mean
You can buy strips for your door
Instead of er san ding them all down and all the paint and that you can put them on the top
Like a wood effect
Yeah
Oh I know you get great big sheets can't you
And that's what she done yeah
And that's what she done to hers and it looks really nice
Really dark wood effect
So that's how they do it then
Cos I've seen them
They're really fine aren't they
Yeah
You know it looks like b al sa wood
Thin
Similar to this but very thin
And it's
Thin and you just stick it on with a glue
Yeah that's it
On either side of the door
Yeah that's it
Oh I might do that
I'm doing that I upstairs
anyway An ge
Yeah
That's okay
I ain't worried about the floor
You've gotta learn some songs
Have you
You've gotta learn some songs
What did you learn today
Er m
When Santa got stuck up the what sit
Chimney
Er m er m er m well I ain't saying it
Give me my card
Give me er m my er m thing
Yeah he got this thing over here
I er m made a Christmas one
Mum's gonna get it for you
There you are
When Santa got stuck up the chimney
He's gotta read that have he
He's gotta sing it
Oh dear
And there's when the robot comes to dinner
This is the one when the robot come to dinner they came on Christmas day
They didn't like the turkey so they threw it all away
They ate up all the knives and forks and then they asked for more
They'd never had a Christmas day quite like that before
That's good inn it
leave it there like that can you fix it
Is it on
Yeah
Oh right
Yeah you just talk normal like you would normally as if you was having a cup of tea
Well you have got you've got a cup of tea
Yes
Like we're having a cup of tea
That's it and that's it
You ought to have seen An ge on it
She went
she knew it was there and then she forgot about it and she was chatting
Yeah you'll be on there
Here I better listen to that to see if they were talking about me
No there isn't nothing like that
some juicy gossip
No it's only me and An ge chatting about my kitchen
And me and Chris talking about money for the kitchen
And that's it
Mum mum are we going
what
So you've done all your Christmas shopping have you
Yeah
What colour 's the
We should have put it on in there
Yeah
We've been gossip ing like anything
Mum
Mummy
People are funny though
You say I've got a tape recorder here
Oh well turn it off
Turn off yeah
Yes Ben
I'm not your mummy but what
I'm going to go to the beach tomorrow Sunday
He's going on about the beach
He's going to the beach tomorrow Sunday
No
No
Yeah
What's this six foot
What's Father Christmas bringing you Ben
Er m a bob b l in
A what
Bob b l in
Bob b l in
A bob b l in
Oh Adam likes those
Yeah
you having a bob b l in
Oh Ben
You stupid thing
Where's my drink where's my drink
Where's your drink
In the cup
Where's my where's my drink
It's in the cup

Er m so what eleven by eleven foot
Eleven by eleven and a half foot I want
It's per foot then so you'd have to what do you want
Eleven eleven by eleven and a half foot
How much is that
Well you want to nip over there and see what they come on on the roll
hang on
No
That one but in the brown
I don't know
Is that it there
No
Yeah
When you see at the carpet placethey come on a nine foot
Here you are there it is
That's beige though inn it it's the colour inn it
So it's off er m six foot six inch what is yours eleven foot
Mm
I'd have to go to that one wouldn't I
Yeah you'd have to have the
Thirteen foot
Thirteen foot
How much would that work out
how much that is look
Oh my god
You alright Ben
Oh my god Is he alright
The chair's alright is it Zoe
Oh yeah your chair's alright
You leaning back on the chair weren't you
Weren't you
Was you
You alright
I hurt my leg
Your leg
Which leg
Which leg
Oh this one
Let's see
Oh give it a good rub
Never mind
Don't lean back on the chairs
I told you about that before
You just sit down nicely
No No
Oh my god
Nownow just sit down
No swinging
Thirteen
How many you want it that way you want eleven
Mm
So it's eleven times that
like that's that one that's that foot that's that foot
So you want it all the way round
So it's that per foot
So it'll be eleven times that
Oh my god
So that'll be over a hundred and forty pound inn it
Yeah
Easy
Easy
No I'll have to go to Great Mills then
Unless there's any others
Which one's that
No I think this is the cheap one
Dear though inn it
Well it is a dear game
That's like us look
There
Unless unless you had together
If you had that
Mm
and you had a down the middle
Mm
Yeah what's that
Well this
Yeah
That's two you'd have to have more of that
Oh
Yeah
Yeah It would still probably work out the same though
Yeah
Not much difference
Yeah
Did he make those numbers
Sit down
Yeah he makes those Zoe
And he makes that as well
Yeah they're good aren't they
Sit down Ben
I thought well they're nice
school Zoe
Mm
Well no I I told her I needed something to encourage him
Get out of that drawer you
O i
Has he colour ed them in
No
Yeah he's got paint brushes I know
They done magic painting the other night
Our gets it everywhere and she was alright
And she was alright
Mm

Mine's like it's a bit it's a bit like this but not as thick
It's Poly ripple inn it
Mm
It's not as thick as that
It is width like that
Yeah
But it ain't as thick
But it's better than mine that is
Mine's like that but very not so much
And I want it like yours but like you said I'd have to buy er m Art ex and get Chris to do it
Once it's on you can't get it off mind
Yeah I know
Gotta sand it off
The Poly ripple peels off though Zoe
It goes like rubber
Does it
Yeah cos I had a I did one roll alright
And er m it was like crooked and I got my nail behind there like that right
And I went like that
get it off
and it peels like rubber
Peels off like rubber
You can get it off
Mm
Perhaps it's sort of on there yeah
Yeah
You gotta paint it like
But it was it was cheaper to by the art ex like that cos it's only three pound a bag look three fifty a bag for a bag of it
Do you know how much I paid
How much
I paid for a tub of poly ripple already with the stuff in it
Yeah
I paid twelve pounds
Yeah but there's stuff you put on before you gotta paint a certain square amount of are a
Mm
and I can keep it on the wall inn it
A bonding
Yeah
Uni bond
Yeah
Something like that
Is it
And then er m
Roll it out after
You gotta roll it out af and you've gotta leave it on so long like overnight and it stinks
And then you've gotta well are a this bit here
Mm
we had to plaster it underneath because er m he had to we just had wires like this down the end
Yeah
They weren't they weren't in the wall
Yeah
So Steve had to chisel all the wall out
M hm
Set them in the wall
I expect you gotta
Mm
Yeah
But I've gotta though
I can't er m there's one lot that just one lot like that
Yeah Steve uses a paintbrush
Find an old paintbrush
Mm
I've got a paintbrush
Yeah
Cos I've been doing round the edges
Now my sister just just had her bathroom just had her bath bathroom art ex ed
Mm
And do you know what she done it with
Her finger
Her finger
And it looks lush
What like bumps like bumps
All she done is S 's
Oh S 's
Little S 's all all over it like that
Yeah
And it looks lovely
Really nice
And I gotta do my bathroom as well
But only down to the til es so mine 'd only be half way
And it's in a Rome pink it is like a sort of a nice pink
It looks really nice it do
And she got her bath in the middle of the bathroom
So you buy a packet of Art ex
You don't buy it in tub s
No
It's a great big bag
Mind this took about well it's inn it
Cos mine's only half way cos the til es are up to here look

Art ex that
Uni bond then

I don't know
About a fiver I expect the Uni bond
And you gotta mix it up
it's like mi mixing a cake
Is it
You gotta have the right consistency and the right colour and
Mm
So you'd probably be better off with that stuff
Cos it might be different texture then look if you've already started
I'm not gonna do it in the kitchen

The Poly ripple
But the bathroom bathroom

But still she seems to be round here all the time more or less don't she
Yeah
She's a bit funny
Do you ever go up her house

Forgot you know but you'd get it back
Oh and she didn't take no bloody notice of me might have been
Well she knows she'sshe's a bit funny then
Otherwise she wouldn't feel so conscious about it
You gotta be careful with her

You know chat I said don't like me hair
She'll go and tell them

Cos An ge said she'd she'd been chatting about Jenny to her
She went and told Jenny
And Jenny asked An ge about it

Maybe it's the best thing she could have done then get a job
Yeah
And now she's paranoid
She thinks everyone's talking about her
I said I've got better things to do than talk about you Lynn
Yeah
And that day we was all over Jenny's
An ge said let's pop in Jenny's
So we go down Jenny's and er the door knocked and I said Christ it's Lynn

You could be an ob an ob tru s ive making that noise
No
No it doesn't
Though it doesn't make a noise cos I was doing it wrong
Yes
It's going slowly now
Yeah
Going much more slowly now as it records more conver conversations
That's it
Mm Don't stop talking now
silly
It's all gonna go quiet now isn't it
Nobody else 'll say anything
at all
That's ridiculous
You gotta

We'll just have to put it down there some time and just put it on
Yeah
So you wouldn't know when it's on or when it's off
Mm
Just have to try and take a little while to get used to it
Once you're used to it it's probably
It's all a matter of getting used to being recorded
Conversation
Yeah well it sounds ever so funny when you hear it
I know
Yeah
Horrible
You think I don't sound like that
Really makes you think
I wish done something about my the way I speak
Mm
Mine's terrible because I've got a low voice a deep voice anyway

I do on the phone don't I
Don't know really
I've not really heard you much on the phone
Used to telephone didn't you
Well yeah but
Didn't know it was me
Oh yeah I knew it was you so it didn't make a lot of difference
People have told me on the phone that I sound cos I've got a deep voice I
You sound different
Vera does
Does she
Mm
She sounds funny on the phone
Most odd
Phone her up and think that's not Vera I'm talking to
Doesn't sound like Vera
But it is although it doesn't sound like her
Funny inn it
What her voice is different
No it just sounds
Or does she talk different because she's on the phone
No just sounds
Some people do
They put their phone voice on
Yeah

Depending how much you got
I don't think I I don't know well I didn't get can ed
I got a swipe or two off Miss
Her with the withered paralyzed arm that she bashed you with because she couldn't clear it and you bloom ing well could
Yeah
Her arm was like this only ever such a little hand and if you she used to go and it just sort of reached your ear hole when she was walking past you and if you were talking in class she'd go
That's all she could move it really was
Just far enough to get your ear hole
like that
Yeah
Stop that
Sit still
She a few times
She was a the sewing mistress
And do you know with this arm it was the right arm as well there was the most beautiful sewing
She used to hold it she sort of took it in here
Yes
and then sew with this hand
Yeah
one hand how she And it was beautiful work
Yeah
she used to do
Yeah
Really did
she used to call us heathens cos we didn't wear vests
So we would deliberately not wear one even if you did
Yeah
if you had to go and try a garment on you deliberately didn't wear underwear or
Oh yeah yeah
just just to annoy Heathens she used to say
Disgusting
Where is your underwear
But I wear a bra miss I've got me underwear
Where is your vest and your liberty bo dice
You will come to a bad end
You gals
Yes Miss we'd all chant
She used to really get not just sit you know really silly old bat
And we had Miss who used to wear knickers down to her knees
She used to sit behind her desk like this with her legs open and her knickers used to come down here pink ones and blue ones
And she used to eat chalk
Eat chalk
Yeah she was ever so odd
She used to
What lumps of chalk
she used to chew it
Mm and it used to be all around her mouth and she used to have a bit here sort of one of those old ladies who had whiskers on her chin and it'd be all white
We didn't take a lot I mean she was a history teacher so now you know why I didn't learn a lot of history cos all we did was gig g le
And if you played up she used to chuck the blackboard rubber at you
She was really dotty
Really was
Absolutely bananas
She always used to sit with her legs open and these bloody knickers
right down her knees
Real passion killers like then
Yeah
It's just as well she wore knickers like that the way she was sitting behind her desk
Well sorry if she didn't wear any at all eh dear eh
Miss but by god she had a good aim she might have been bloody dotty
You got up giggling and laughing the back of the class and whoosh the bloody board rubber come flying across the classroom
Mm and bloom ing hurts and all
That terrible what they're gonna do with them
Put them away for life we hope
They ought to
Seem to put them away for a long while but
Would you like anything before you go out dear
Mm I don't think so
To abandon me to your friends
Oh here we go again
Don't love you any more heard it all before I know
I've abandoned abandoned you all day most of the day darling and
I know
We're on holiday and I'm being left on my own
Cruel cruel hard man
I know
Not stopping you going boozing though is it
Well there's you're quite welcome to come with me if you want to
I don't want to
You don't want to
Well there you are then
If you don't want to you don't want to
Well it's about quarter to seven so I suppose you're soon going to be off
So a little bit of discipline and a clip round the ear hole obviously done them good
Oh they don't know half
I was gonna say they discipline hard to discipline 's much more
Oh we had much more discipline when we were young than they have nowadays and I don't think it does them any harm
No
If my children came home and said to me that they got the cane at school I'd have just said well you must have deserved it
I wouldn't have gone rush I mean some mothers have gone rushing up the school and complained
I said well he must have done something to deserve it
Mm
Otherwise they wouldn't have done it
Jonathan the other two didn't so much
Jonathan did couple of times
He come home with lines and write passages out of this that and the other
Yeah
Well Steven used to tell on him you see
He's been in detention again
Tell - t a l e
What you tell her for
Huh You telly - t a l e oh you're too goody goody you never get
Over ex uber ant that's what they put on Jonathan 's report school report
Good for some things
Ex uber ant
That's what one of his school reports said
Jonathan suffers with an over ab abundance of ex uber an ce
When I were at the parents' evening I said does that mean er he never sits still and he's always tearing about and
said well something like that
Yeah but probably now they'd call it hyper activity
Probably
I don't think he was he was just I dunno
A lad
Yeah
And I I er and not only that I used to say to teachers well if if they'd ask him about and if he had anything er er and he'd be bored
Mm
why do you Jonathan S t Steven said oh he'd been in detention
Why have you been in detention
Oh I was playing up and they chuck ed me out the class or something and I had to stay in at dinner time
Said well why were you playing up
I was bored
I tried telling some of the teachers that
He finds the lessons boring so obviously they're gonna mess about
Yeah
If they're b or if you're bored and you can't
Bored yeah
So you you get distracted and do something else
Yeah
you shouldn't be doing
And that's a fault in some ways of the teachers
Mm
If the pupils are bored the should make it interesting enough to keep their interest
Yeah
Mm
Yeah I know subjects they're not you can't be interested in all of them
No
Look at them cars
When I was at the garage getting the petrol I give them signed the cheque and they put the cheque through the cheque machine printing it out and that and er they've got a free offer at the moment
You collect these tokens for collect so many tokens and you get a free Cor gi toy
I mean normally I don't bother with the tokens I mean I Anyway I paid the cheque and I said to Peter I said oh by the way what about me tokens for me for me toy I said if I get a free one of them I can give it to give it to the grandchildren
See Ricky 'd like that I'm sure little Cor gi car I said
He said oh no you don't get them with cheque s
Cash sales only
I thought I just spent twenty seven quid on petrol I said
And you can't even have a bloody free Dinky car
free couple of voucher s for a new for a Cor gi toy
There's a woman in there she said oh give it to him
I said give you a cuddle some time
Mm
I just thought you know I okay it's only a cheque I know but
Yeah but it's still twenty seven quid
They don't get many twenty seven pound customers
No
That's what I thought
Fiver or what have you
I think it's I think it's one voucher for fifteen li tres
Now what do I have
If I had twenty seven quid 's worth at fifty P a lit re that's fifty two fifty two
Fifty two li tres roughly so if it was one voucher for fifteen that's three inn it
And I think it was six voucher s for for a free
That's it
free Cor gi toy
So all I've got to do is when I run out again fill it up again spending another twenty five quid 's worth or so that would have been six and I could have had a free Cor gi toy for Ricky for Christmas
Yeah
Or whatever
Yeah
Little present inn it
Yeah
Hasn't cost me nothing has it
Or hasn't cost you anything
But next time I shall have to run take the cash in there
And see see what they say next time
Mm
pays a cheque it was just easier to pay by cheque
And they've got a machine to do it anyway to work it all out print it all out
Not very fair is it
Oh no
Saying cash I mean it's still cash inn it
Would have thought so
big business that
Yeah
Toys
Terrible prices
Bet mum's still got that

Smell like a bloody brewery
Told you that's not a bad little pub is it
What the
It's a gold mine
Absolute gold mine
Told you that and you said yuk
I don't mind it in there
It's years since I've been in there
Must be about three or four years since I've been in there
Not bad is it
Oh no
It's a nice pub
say that but er they've extended it
Yeah I know
down the back and out the back there for darts and that
I know
I know and a little stage
I've seen yeah I have
round the corner a bit
Well maybe maybe they maybe they change it round when there there's something on there and there's no darts on or that
Mm yeah probably
Because er m because er Sue
Mm
thing and her dad's got a country and western music I mean he they go all over the bloody place
But we we were in there one night and he he was playing
They had country and western night on there now I think I was doing nowt one Saturday night and Sue and Steven were going to hear her dad
Mm
Why don't you come with us for an hour or so
Mum 'll be there after bingo at half past nine
Mm
I was going to bingo and I said and I said to her well we'll go and pick Sue's mother up and we'll pick you up and all and she went the Empire I went the Corn Exchange but that's beside the point
Yeah
Yeah
And picked us up and I went in there and I were yeah half past eleven time
I mean it was a bit loud because it was live music I suppose but it wasn't a bad night
got lively
I say it was say it was about threefour years since I've been in there so
Oh
they'd extended it they extended it round the back and
Yeah
Well I was it was round the back where
Oh it
he stood with er m the
It's probably where they've got the dart board and that in there
Probably change it round
Yeah there is
And there was a bit of there's a bit of floor in front of it
And we were dancing on that bit you see
Oh did you
There weren't a lot of room but you don't care do you
When you've
Mm little dance and
at ten o'clock at night and pub was packed
People singing with the the group
Yeah he plays guitar and sings Sue's dad does
Stew i e in The Loco well huh
You know everybody
Well not everybody but
Biggest part
Knew the landlord
Who I hadn't seen for goodness knows how long
Hall o Stew i e how are you mate
Bloody hell's that
Knew his face and I can't remember his damn name
Gary
Might even have had my Steven in wouldn't have known him
Yeah he would
How do you know
Because there wasn't a tall slim ginger - h a i r e d chap in
I did think it well I did think it was a possibility but I mean
Probably his mother and father her mother and father had been in there anyway
there's a little boy there'd be no chance of him going in there anyway
Oh no course not
Course not
So
I'm going soft in the her mum and dad'll probably be in
That's their regular if they were having a country and western they would ask him to do it because he's
What's his what's her mum and dad look like
He's big
He's a such a big fella
Fat
Sue's mum's little and fat nearly as tall as she's broad
But dad's a
Maybe they were in the lounge perhaps
bigger I mean he he he's at least as tall as you if not bigger and er also
Sort of Tom size
Yeah
And she's about the same size round but about five foot two
Well I didn't see anybody
Sue's a big girl
She's as tall as me and weighs nearly
Mm
she must weight fourteen fifteen stone I should think
Sue's big
Well then I certainly didn't see anybody in there looking like that
I must admit
Oh she usually goes after bingo
They'll probably be in all night and she's just walked up from the bingo and todd le in there
No I didn't see anybody looking like that so I don't know
I wouldn't think they'd be in the lounge
They could be but I wouldn't have thought so
Thursday night anyway I wouldn't does she go to the Empire
Well I don't really know do I
Empire
Do they have it Wednesday night bingo
Thursday night don't they bingo
Is it Thursday night
No oh I don't know
Thursday night not at the Empire
Wednesday night the Empire Friday night
Thursday night

Yeah
Cos they live down round near Tina's but not like Tina's house before that off All a rd Avenue round the back of All a rd Avenue
Sherwood is it

Yeah
Yeah they live up yeah
So it's not that far for The Loco really
No just a short walk
It's sort of their local type of thing
anyway but Well Ann is going to retire
I suppose you're gonna have a bottle and a fag
Mind you the smell of you I think you've had sufficient bottles but
well
Told you not to drink much
I did n't
Ooh
Perhaps I'd better stop up then
Well I tried not to but
What
Bob said do you want a drink and Ron said do you want a drink and I said to Ron do you want a drink Ron and everyone said do you want a drink and
You had quite a few
No not that many
But er
But I might as well go to bed
probably er m
But I might as well go to bed
And you do realize that this conversation is on a tape recorder
Well I don't mind
if it is
That's what they want
Natural conversations so
Not sure how natural though
I'll have a can of beer and then I'll probably go to bed
We haven't got any left
I drunk them
They've gone have they
M hm
Oh
I'd better have a bottle then
I drunk them as well
Oh you drunk them as well
Oh
ah oh now what am I gonna do
Without
I'm without
Crafty devil
Put them round the corner where where I didn't know where they were
Falling over now
No I'm not
Oh that young couple next door ah
Yeah
They been at it have they been at it again
Oh I wish you'd have been at home I'd have gone round there
What've they been up to now then
Oh god
She's been screaming
He's been reckon she must have locked herself up in the dark
And the only place with a lock on is the bathroom and I reckon they'll bloom ing knock the bloom ing door down by the sound of it
G aw d
She was screaming he was swearing
Running up and down the stairs
What time was this
Quarter to ten till about half past ten
Or half an hour till half past ten
Well that wouldn't please them next door would it
No
Co o
And and really I mean you can't I'm I'm s I'm saying that you you can't interfere but by god I'd long for someone to come in and interfere
I really would have done
And er er I I could never understand why people that obviously could hear what went on and pretended they never
I know you don't wanna get involved
Mm
and this that and the other but people must have heard what went on and and you know the next morning they'd see a black eye and just carry out a normal conversation as though
and you know they hadn't heard it all and
Yeah
ooh have you had a fall or something
Then you know I mean they must have what was going on oh aye they just completely ignore it
Mm
I'd be walking round if I could get around
Mm
It were just you know oh it's a nice morning when I'm hanging the washing out as though everything was wonderful you know
Yeah
normal
Yes
Ooh I thought he was going too oh I felt made me go cold and I I thought if if I hadn't been here on my own I'd have been very tempted to go round and and say is there anything I can do
Or I'd have called the police I think
I weren't sure what I'd have done but
Bad as that
Oh
He was a calling her ef f ing this swearing oh it was dreadful
She was screaming and you could hear her crying
Then you hear she pounded up the bloody stairs and he was after her and I reckon well the only room with a lock
As you say is the bathroom
is the bathroom so she must have been in there cos he's hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it
Bloody hell of a row
Or whether she opened it or whether she was in the front bedroom with something behind the door I dunno but
That's his
and she run back down the stairs and the front door was opening and banging and shutting whether she run outside or what I don't know what happened the dog was bloody barking
Oh lord
Well it's a wonder Ann and Rita haven't done something about it
Well I say it's er amazing they've not said said something
And they had company as well there's a car there blue car
Who Ann and Rita or
Or Ann and Rita
I don't know
Sally inn it
I don't know who it was
It was Sally if it was a blue e blue cavalier
T D O something something something
Sally can't drive so it must be some
Can't she
Her latest beau I should think I don't know
Maybe
Maybe maybe
But it was I mean I could hear it over the telly
I know I don't have the telly on full blast but I could hear it
Mm
above the telly
When I first heard the first noise I thought what the bloody hell's that and I turned the sound down
Yeah
Thought bloody hell put it back up but you could it was really distressing me cos
You knew what was possibly going on
Yeah
Mm
A woman and that don't s I mean if you're having just an argument it's raised voices but a woman doesn't scream and cry like that unless
Unless there's something really
something awful going on
Mm
I mean Ann and Rita reckon they're not married or anything but why the hell does she stay with him then
She's not got a bloody
Well there you go I mean
she's got no children
They're only young
It's her house
Isn't his
He couldn't she bought it without with her father and
Mm
and he come and lived with her in it
Bloody hell
I know I mean I stayed with him but I had three kids
Gonna say you're you're
I had three kids where could I go with them
Mm
Mm
If I'd have been on me own I mean that's all I was waiting for mine to grow up so I could clear off
Yeah
If I'd have been on me own I wouldn't have stopped bloody long
I mean even if she walks out he doesn't no court in the land would give him the house if it's hers
evicted and then she could come back again
Mm
Well if she went to the police they'd chuck him out
He has no legal rights to the property
It's in her name she's her father's helping her paid the deposit or something and she clears the mortgage she has no right he has no right to it all if she went to the police
They'd just turf him out wouldn't they
Mm
Well why stay in a relationship like that
Don't understand it
Certainly a bit rough a bit hard
Went quiet about half past ten so whether he buggered off out or what I don't know
Mm maybe
Certainly the front door was opening and banging and shutting
Say I'm surprised Ann and Rita haven't sort of didn't
Well banging on the wall probably with all the other banging and
May maybe
Maybe
They part of the banging
So much bloody banging going on
Probably part of the banging Ann and Rita
And the people on this side you don't know how they were reacting as well
Say they was a quite young couple
We don't hear them that much do we
Mornings is the time I hear them most
Cos they go out to work at half past eight and you hear them between half past seven and half past eight
There you are I've made you a cup of tea
Thank you dear
Very kind of you
Are you sure you don't want any breakfast
No
You want nothing at all
No
You'll be hungry
Eh
What do you mean good
Don't be silly
What's the point in getting really hungry
Had me tea last night and the beer and few sandwiches last night
How would you like that
Order 's not completed you've got to stay till it is
Up yours mate
I'm going home
Ten o'clock and that's it
Or whatever
Not many would
Very rare
Not often
Oh my god
I had that yesterday
What's our post code
P E fourteen seven P G.
They was looking for it on a list
Mm
Said I know it's P fourteen I don't know the rest of it
And he looked on a list he had and he put seven something
Seven P G.
I can always remember it
Well you're good at remembering numbers
Well yeah but I just think P E fourteen half of fourteen is seven and then T.
G.
Yes darling
So that's how I remember it
Funny inn it
Yes very strange but you are strange
I know yes
Very strange yeah very strange
You always remember numbers
Don't you
Car numbers and telephone numbers and
Car numbers I remember more by the letters than the numbers
Because there are s specific set numbers
Once I see
When they come round at work and says this car blocked in I say oh go and ask Stuart he'll probably know
Give you a bloom ing it's a blue something or other and this is the number
Go and ask
I said go and Stuart or Bill they they know most of them
I wouldn't know one from another
associated the letters with the car and the letters with the car go together
And then the numbers the numbers I don't remember that well
Some of them I do
now with them changing the the change over cos they always used to be the letters followed by the numbers
Now they've got the initial letter followed by the number then the letters
Rather than so As I say you associate the car and the number together
I don't
It would probably throw me completely If you
it would throw me completely if you put if you changed some of the number plates over
If you put Tina's number plate on another car and visa ver sa that would throw I I'd probably look at it and think you know oh somebody's got a new car or that looks familiar but it's not the right car so I wouldn't think about it
Even though I know Tina's is C two one one Y C L if it was on a different car I'd probably look at it and think
Oh that's not right
it's not right it's not Tina's
And so I wouldn't think that that I probably Just a just a t ra it of personality
I wonder how she is if she's at work or at home
Don't really don't really care to tell you the truth in a way but
Oh that's nice
Well no I care I care if Tina's not well and hope she gets better soon but I don't care if
You don't care about work getting in a muddle
I don't care about work and them being in a muddle no not at all
Let them get on with it
That's not very nice
It is
No it isn't
Well it is
Why isn't it
Cos it isn't
Well
if a lot of others were off we'd have to cope somehow wouldn't we
So there you go
Just cos we're off
And possibly Tina and that is off so they'll just have to struggle on as if we were there and a lot of others were off
Don't you agree
Yes darling
Right
So what's on the agenda for today
Well you know very well
We are going shopping
Where are we going shopping
Whenever you're ready to take me shopping
But where are we going shopping
Well probably W is be c h
No point in going to Lynn if we're going to mum's
No but where
Wherever you wish to take me
Where would Ann want to go
I don't mind
Haven't got a lot of choice
I don't like Tes cos at W is be c h cos it's
Right
So it's Gateway Gateway or bloom ing Rainbow
Suppose we could go down the Rainbow and have a look at that microwave
But I'll have to go into town first
Cos I don't think they'll give me the shopping for nothing and there's no bank down Rainbow
Well there is a Co - o p bank but I don't think they'll let me have some money out of it
Mm
Maybe not
And seeing as I haven't got an account with them I don't think they'll say well you can have some anyway
No
No
And then we're going into town
Well we've got to go into town
Got to see the estate agents and see if we can view something today
Mm
other ones that we are definitely interested in and underneath the ones that we are not so interested in
Yeah there's one down that one down Elizabeth Terrace
I was just trying to figure out which one it is
Hundred and twenty
I don't know if that isn't er m what they call it who died not long ago
Hazel 's mum's
Cos perhaps the dad's moved out or you know
Quite close to her
Oh what was her name
Old Hazel 's mother
Hazel 's mother
The little old lady who went to Salvation Army always wearing a little hat
Oh what was her name
Cos you know her as well
And I said oh my god she's died and you said oh I know her
What used to go to the Salvation Army
She was to Salvation Army
Ever so small little lady
or something
I can remember her kids and I can't remember her name
Terrible
Hazel and Terry mother - i n - l a w ' s brother Terry fire officer at W is be c hit's his mother - i n - l a w laws
And she died not more than a few months ago
Oh it's awful
It's dreadful I mean quite fond of her
Just trying to think which one it was anyway
I think it's her house
Yeah but I'm trying think which one it is
Cos I say I know that I know Elizabeth Terrace well
Yeah I know cos I think you called on her cos you knew her
When she died you said oh I know her well
Hundred and twenty
Let's go and have a look
Oh it's in here somewhere inn it
I put a ring round it so I know
Oh yeah here we are hundred and twenty
Ah the one one in from the end
Yeah I know the one now
One in from the end
I think that is her house
Mind she had a husband but should think he living with one of the kids
Can't think who lived there now
God cos I used to call on that one
perhaps
The only trouble down Elizabeth Terrace parking
That's the only trouble
The only consolation if
the college
if that was a possibility or if that became a possibility mum only live round the corner
Not that far away is she
Few hundred yards
She drives
And I could leave the car in her driveway
Then there's the college
Lot of people park in the college
Don't they
So that is a pos si I was just wondering which one it was cos I say I know some of them are a bit you know
Yeah
a bit dodgy
I knew there there they had a lot of trouble with one of them but nearer Helen's end
There was one there that was empty and for a long long while
The builders started building knocking it about
And it fell to bits
And then it
and then no the ran out of money
The build er ran out of money and the it was just a shell
You know nothing in it
No windows no doors no nothing er you know completely gutted it to make it all to renovate it and then ran out of money and then it just stood there completely empty
And can you imagine a house in the open air in winter
Do it a lot of good would it
It wouldn't do it a lot of good no exactly
Woodwork and
exactly
and even the brickwork
No
damp and If you get me back to mum's for about three o'clock time at the latest to take her to Osborne House
Well that's what she's that's what she's she's she just sort of she didn't mean it but
No it
it was her thought that we were
Yeah cos I mean you'd probably run her back rather than her b i king
As I say I mean we if we could make an appointment say three fifteen or three thirty to see Sefton Avenue
Cos we'd be up there anyway
Yeah
Wouldn't we
Before it gets dark and you couldn't see anything anyway
Oh we'd have to go and have a look in the light
Well that's it
Definitely
cos you can't see a lot
Cos there won't be electricity on
Anyway you wanna have a good look round seriously consider it
Cos I think now we haven't heard from Mr and I think that means he's not prepared to take it so he's not bothered about coming
Yeah
Is that the way you're reading it
That's the way I'm reading it
I'm
Ignore it cos the man might just leave him in there renting it until or when forever it goes up
But we can't afford it to go up
I'm disappointed that he's not been back
Yeah I am
to discuss it
Yeah I am
And to put the position to him
Look the market's not very good I know but we're sitting tenants
We're quite happy to take it on
We'd like to take it on
If we leave have you got another tenant to come in
You're gonna lose two hundred and fifty pound a month
And a good two hundred and fifty pound a month
Exactly
You know not one that he has any hassle in getting
That's it
He don't have to keep calling and wandering around after us
But I'm not prepared to go on renting it
No no
As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off a place of our own is is just I mean if I have to rent it well I'll have to rent one
If we can't get anything else and we can't afford anything else we've just got to go on paying it but
But
when there's so much other
as I say you look at I mean this is two fifty
You look here in the paper and see how much they are
Yeah I know
Some of them are terrible
You're talking two sixtytwo eighty
I know
Three hundred
To let
Three seventy
No
Detached four bedroom ed house admittedly
Gran a ry
Two b two two bed
That's the one I fancy
If I went anywhere into another flat I'd quite fancy going into
Two bed second floor self - c o n t a i n e d flat
Living room kitchen bathroom twelve months two seventy five un furnished
Mm I know
Armada Close two eighty
Norfolk Street two eighty
Mm I wouldn't I wouldn't go in to Armada Close I don't think
That's furnished
Six months
Two eighty
Yeah well you see furnished you see they can charge extra
Norfolk Street self - c o n t a i n e d principally first floor flat two bedrooms furnished two eighty
I wouldn't want a furnished one now
No of course not
But as I say
I know they are expensive
Which is why I
Two sixty two eighty which is the same price as
which which is why now er that Rose and Jean when they considered it
Mum said how about renting one in W is be c h but I said well if she can't afford a mortgage you can't afford to rent one
Not anything that's worth living in
No
fifty quid a week ones are er forty pound a week and so on
You gets what you pay for which nowadays isn't a lot not for that money
You know when I asked was gonna have er on Lynn Road there what was that fifty a fifty a week
I mean it was
Fifty or fifty five weren't it
it was clean but that's about all you could say
Is that the one Ann is in now
Or in that are a
I don't know where Ann is
No I think she's down Victoria Road somewhere
She won't tell anybody
But I think she lives somewhere down Victoria Road
I don't know
She's only in a beds it
Yeah
But I mean you see her up town though
I know
That's cos she's lonely and she just wanders about
She gets up
don't want to stay in the beds it
One room she she shares a bathroom and kitchen
She just goes for a walk
I mean she's seeing people and
Yeah but I mean the times I've seen her it's been this end of town rather than that end of town
Which has made which which just makes me think
I don't really I just presume she lives down Victoria Road somewhere but I don't really know
And she walks to work
She couldn't do any other
She hasn't got a vehicles he can't afford one
No no
But that just makes me think why that's what makes me think she's living
She could be
But that weren't a bed sitter that I was in
Shared bathroom but I
No but yeah
but it was a kitchen and bedroom and living room
They're only tiny like an al cove bedroom but
Oh yeah I've been in one of them
You know I've seen them
I mean it was the only one with a with its own kitchen
The one that I was gonna have
Yeah
This was right up the top and there were a tiny attic bedroom thing was made into a not very sal u b rio us but it had a cook er and a sink
Yeah
And as I say that was fifty or something a week and it wasn't wasn't worth it really
No
Furniture wasn't that posh but then er but the only thing I thought about it was safe and it was clean
Needed a bit of personal iz ing but it was it was old - f a s h i o n e d furniture but it was polished
It was clean
Had a reasonable carpet on the floor and and so on
Mm
But it wasn't worth fifty pound a week
Definitely not
But that's what they're going for though isn't it
If they can get them for that
people do
People are desperate to buy and they'll have whatever and they have to pay
Yeah
When you think that one what was thirty three thousand two hundred and sixty a month or something wasn't it
Well that's gonna be about two hundred and fortytwo hundred and fifty a month for that one down
Cos thirty three worked out two sixty didn't it
Oh the mortgage you mean
Mortgage
So you can say two hundred and fifty pound a month to buy a place
Oh yeah
And yet they want two eighty to rent one
Seems quite ridiculous
Well that's if you're prepared to buy a flat
That's the only thing isn't it
If you're prepared to buy a flat
Yeah but at least you've got actually got the property haven't you
You're not just paying somebody else to have a Cos if you're moving if you can't sell it you can always rent it again
Which is what a lot of people are doing houses especially
They buy a house cos they've had a child or something
They can't afford to they can't sell that one so they rent that out which pays the mortgage for it and start again on another mortgage
You've got to be a bit careful when you're renting out though
Oh yes
Got to be careful of your tenants
pay
Tenants
That's why it's best to go through an agency or er something like White and Eddie s because they have people that collect them and they have people who have to take up references and
Yeah but not only that but I mean if you
And they have they have proper leases
I mean after that they're out and
Yeah
well I mean all all well it counts towards your in come as well
Oh yeah I know
Oh yeah in come tax on it
Counts counts towards your in come
But a lot of people are doing it
Mm
Oh I know
Well there's for one
sell
Lot of people are doing it because they just can't well circumstances
It's either the job or something means they've gotta go away or they can't afford they can't sell them so they I don't know if that would make your in come different if you were still paying a mortgage
Even though your all the money
Think
you were getting in was getting paid out again
I think you'll find it counts towards your in come
So I mean if you had a job
Paying them more tax
You you got a job say you're earning
But I think the expenses when you're
earning ten thousand a year
And you're going you're getting two hundred and fifty pound a month as well in rent
Yeah but you you'd be able to claim expenses
I think so yeah
You wouldn't pay the whole of it tax able if it was you know you would claim expenses for one thing and another
Oh I don't know but I mean I wouldn't have thought so
Yeah
Otherwise probably that's why they are dear because they have to do things like that
That's probably why they're the price they are two eighty
That's it
Because people take
Pay fifty and thirty quid a week more is a bloody what they get stopped off them
and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina
And to pay off the mortgage they've got to charge so much
I mean Tina's got that little house
I mean now you'd get it two hundred and fi I mean Tina pays two hundred and forty eight er pound a week a month
Three hundred and forty eight pound a month mortgage on that little house
Yeah
I mean that was bloody thirty nine thousand or was it forty one when she had it
It was
I know
forty one I think
I mean now they're going for thirty two
We can afford one like that
Yeah we could isn't it
Mm
They don't sell now
Not selling at all
There's a few renting now cos they can't sell them
So It's a nice enough little house but I'm not awfully keen on it are you
I don't like the I don't like the bedroom
No I don't
situation for one
If it had a door and a wall and
You're just straight upstairs and you fall into bed
Mm
Handy I suppose but
In some respects but I mean it just doesn't I mean in a way I suppose well with Tina being a non smoke r and Wig gi e being a non smoke r
It's not so bad
isn't so bad but I mean if you're like us and I mean the smoke's just
That's it
That's why Tina doesn't like people smoking in her house because it gets into her bedroom
Yes
Exactly
The smoke would just rise straight up and
Yeah
straight up into the bedroom
I mean she doesn't smoke anyway so I mean you know
She doesn't like people smoking in her house
Because she says I don't want my bedroom smelling of smoke her sheets and everything else
She would do
Mind you they have done a bit more to it since Wig gie's been there in as much as she's had a big curtain put across
Oh yeah
Across the top of the stairs like or
All the way across
Because Steve couldn't sleep
Because of the light in that little
Because it's light
See you'd even the patio door light went
Straight upstairs
straight upstairs
And that
Because he's and then
skylight
Mm yeah
skylight
He's had a blind put up a special blind that leads straight across the fan light
And she's had curtains big track put across so that sh
She can shut it off
she can shut it right off
She couldn't she just wasn't sleeping
Said was broad daylight
M hm
She said oh he you know we've had all that done
Tracked across the ceiling so that shut the off
She said he just couldn't sleep in there
With the light
With all the lights and daylight and sunshine through the bloody thing and It was alright once he got off but he had a job getting off when it was
Mm mm
as I say when it was sunlight shining through the bloody thing on his face
Mm they've had a special they had a skylight blind made
Mm mm
They couldn't have an ordinary one cos it would hang down
Has to be on a runners on the side as well otherwise it would just fall down
Side yeah so it fall
Yeah
Mm
It's got a you know like a frame what you put in along
Like a venetian blind in a way
Mm
Or a straight down blind but at an angle but er but on runners to hold yeah
But it's got runners to hold the side in you see
Yeah
I mean but Steven would but
Do they owe
the building society and er m
the building society
Yeah
They'll have to pay another mortgage as well
Yeah but on the yeah but I mean if she sold it for thirty two she'd still owe them nine thousand wouldn't she
Well she must have paid a bit off
She's been in there about three years
Yeah
Well say she owes them nine thousand anyway
Yeah
But then er if they wanted another mortgage it would be
That would be added to it you see
They'd probably have a fifty thousand pound mortgage to pay off the the existing mortgage on that one and the balance
I mean they can afford it between them
Well I don't know I mean Steve must pay about eighty pounds a bloody week
Oh yeah of course Steven and his maintenance
Maintenance
Maintenance and one thing and another
Yeah
Yeah that would cut it down wouldn't it on their own you can say they'd be able to afford it but if you consider the out goings as well eighty pound a
Mind you saying that three hundred fifty pound a month to buy a bigger mortgage anyway
Nowadays
For the interest rate yeahbut it would only buy the same sort of mortgage that Tina's got on it already
Yeah well that's what I mean
They could have bought afford a
Yeah
a a better property for about forty four thousand or whatever for the same money
Cos that's how it's worked out
No cos she still owes if she sold it she'd still owe the balance between the selling price and
Yeah so she's got to buy a cheaper one and that would be added to it
That would be added to it you see
Mm and just his wages how much extra they could afford
That's it
I know Steven would like
Mm
He'd like one with a spare bedroom so the children can come and stop
I mean Tina's worried now she's got his mother coming for christmas for a fortnight
Don't know where the hell she'll sleep she's got to sleep in the living room
Mm
But that's about fifty isn't it
Fifty two probably get the fifty
As I say you're looking at a
Hefty mortgage
Tina reckons out of her wages she's got ninety ninety six pound a week out of her wages just for mortgage and
Expenses
expenses
That's gone before she starts
And then out of Wig gie's he's got
Seventy five I think he pays
It's a lot of money gone before you've even
M hm before you even start
Mm
Depends what you want most don't it I suppose
Mm mm
That's true
She'd like to change the car
I mean she never liked that car
Ever
She had a nice car before Chris made her have that more or less
She didn't want it
She hated it at first she wouldn't drive it
Noisy and clumsy she didn't like it at all
She never has really
It's not it's not a bad car is it
She doesn't like it
Never been happy with it
Never
It was Chris 's idea to have the diesel one and that model
He talked her into it
Yeah
But she hated it at first
She'd do anything rather than drive it at first
I don't know what she had before but it was a
Mm
Mind you it was quite old
I think it was a car that she'd had for was well looked after her dad used to see to it for her but it was she'd had it for some years and she was always poo d ling about in you see
And it was her second car that she'd ever had sort of thing
Mm
She'd had it five or six years or something like that
You know think it was about ten year old when she got rid of it
Something like that
Yeah
But say it was a lovely little car really
And she hated that
Mm
Times she used to go really hate it
Yeah if that one that Elizabeth Terrace one is is the one I think it is which is the one fairly near the end in that in that bottom bottom row I think the live in the first one they still live in the first one on the corner
I'm not sure if they've moved actually now
They may have done
Got a funny feeling they have now
But Who's that
Paper man
Bloody hell
Morning
Did somebody kick you out of bed this morning Brian
Thank you very much
Thank you
Bu bye
Thought somebody must have kicked him out of bed this morning
Only half half past ten
quarter past ten
That ain't bad
Got the time to have a quick look at the paper now haven't we
Yeah
The Standard
I don't mind
Oh mind at all
And if we make an appointment to view some places and then we'll know what time we've got to doing the shopping and fit it in round taking mum
Seeing mum
something er m next week
So you don't fancy this afternoon
In the morning
Oh yeah well yeah I mean if if they if
Cos as I say if we did see Sefton Avenue or New Drove today
If there's nothing available
That's what I meant
Oh yeah there's plenty of time
I don't really want to go on a Saturday
Saturday afternoons with mum
Saturday afternoons with Helen
well I wouldn't be absolutely if if I had to go out then I'd have to go out
Then there's always Saturday morning see Helen but then Stuart likes to sleep in
But no I think Saturday's out really
It's not a day for viewing houses
We could go out Sunday
And mum could come as well
I don't know whether they work
Oh yes
People at work all the week don't they
Yes
Gets dark in the evenings then then then definitely
That's the only time you can view a property
I mean unless somebody's living in it you can't go in the evenings in the winter can you
And I don't fancy a house that somebody's actually living in
Cos then you've got ta wait while they
Yeah
And it can all fall through because theirs is falling through or they can't get out when you want and that can go on for Can it not
Yeah
Sometimes it just can't be helped cos there's nothing in your price range you know that you like that isn't empty but I would prefer an empty property so that when we decide and then whatever just
Certainly if we'd see something that would do this afternoon or New Drove today that's fine
No problem
Two of them at New Drove are downstairs and one is an upstairs
The one upstairs because it hasn't got a bay window
Yes
is larger
The upstairs one is slightly larger
The upstairs one's larger
number seven which is an upstairs one hasn't got any bay windows
It is larger than the two five and six that are downstairs
Who's selling that one
Well one's Cornerstone
One's Cornerstone
So one's Cornerstone and two are the other
Two are Hansard
Yeah
I think it's Cornerstone one that's the larger of the two the three
Six seven
Hansard
Hansard
They're doing five and seven so they've got one above each other
So they've got one one's doing two and one's doing one
One's doing five and seven which is this is for two and one's doing six which is this one
Yeah
Seven is definitely slightly bigger than six and five
I checked it out
The lounge is fourteen by ten
The bedroom is thirteen nine by nine instead of eleven by eight
That kitchen's thirteen by five that totals eleven by seven
Neither here nor there is it
No
None of it's much difference
It's only a diff er it's a matter of two feet here and
Yes
But then I don't mind
I don't mind living upstairs or on the ground
Well I mean if they've got the key to both might haven't decided on both of them you might as well go and see them
Yeah
Both of them
See which one you like the best or if you like them at all
But as it's got that financial package
That's Cornerstone
Yeah
Don't know whether the same applies to the other two
it
The financial package
With Cornerstone
Cornerstone
Doesn't actually say that in Pant i les
No
Oh
Just have to ask
Yeah
But actually the one at Cornerstone is fifty pound cheaper than the both of them at Hansard
It is
Fifty pound
One's nine nine fifty and one's nine nine
five yeah
So it's forty five pound different
Well that's a good way if you think about it he's got he's got four flats there hasn't he
Oh yeah
Four flats at thirty thousand
That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses
They could be sixty thousand apiece
Yeah
Whereas if he had if he sold them as separate houses he'd probably get forty thousand apiece
Yeah that's just Yeah
Forty five thousand even apiece
Yeah
But he's making the money by selling them as flats
Yeah
The only difference is he's had a few thousand extra because it's got two kitchen s and two bathrooms
part i tions and
Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings
But apart from that oh an extra bath instead of the other bedroom
Yeah
Yeah
and er m another kitchen instead of a dining room or something and that's the only difference
Say three four thousand probably
For the extra bits and pieces that's all
Yeah
I don't know how many of them there are
Whether they only had four flats or whether there's a flat on another block and another block of fours down the road
I mean I don't know
Only assume there's you've got that one block
Well there might be four blocks of four or I du n no
No I don't think so
Not enough space for them
No I don't know
I mean you know the are a better than me
Unless they've knocked them garages down or something
I've no idea
I know them council houses aren't usually but I mean I can't visualize how much land there is
I only know that by going to school and
Yeah
where they are
Yeah
Probably should have gone the other way into town but
that
Eh
Neither here nor there
Well you could have gone sort of like round the Rainbow and that way on
That's what I meant
the bypass that end of town would have been perhaps a little bit clearer
If you look at the first it might help you to decide whether you like
That's it
Whether you wanna go and see it
Whether you wanna go and see them or not
Whether you like the positions
I mean we know where Sefton Avenue is and we know that's
Well we know where it is
a nice house
Well we don't know really
We haven't seen it have we
Well I mean I mean
Yeah but we haven't actually looked ins
No but I mean I know which house it is with that one and you do don't you
I think so yes
Well I think so as well
But it would be nice just to go and have a quick check
Oh I think just to make sure that
Just to make sure I like it
Or
it is the house that we're thinking about
We think it is
You may not like it
I said as soon as I see it in the paper oh that looks nice
Where's that
I mean not sure
is it
Or is this the one round the other end
It's that one
It's up here
That one there right on the corner yeah
Yes
That's it
I thought there was a separate but it's not no it's not is it
Think it is
It's an older property
Got the double glazing
Alright
Looks nice
Nice house though isn't it
Yeah it's an older more solid house
You know sometimes I like as I say they've got
Yeah
Yeah Yeah true
Very true
they've got er m
Very true
Yeah it's a nice house
And this is a back the back door
Oh I see
Yeah
this one because you there's the back view look I mean that's that's a back door isn't it
So you have the downstairs back and the the front stairs go up to the can't actually see That's definitely the back door
There's a parking space as well
Oh yeah it says allotted parking space
We have made him an offer but he's not very keen
I don't think I don't think he will
He's not like that
It looks as if he's not very keen on the price we want to pay
He said he knows the market's low and he'd rather wait
But then we wouldn't be able to afford it if the market goes up and
That's right
same time
If it's on if it's on the market for a long while
He can have it on the market for a year or so
Yeah
And he's and he's
He's got you there and
Well at the moment he's got us
Well that's it
I mean we're paying two hundred and fifty pound a month so at least he's getting that coming in
But then you can really have a mortgage for that
and the thing is as well
No
But at the moment he's well he's not come back to us with any answer from our offer at all so we're we're pre sum ing that means no so we thought we'd better start looking
Oh and if you're paying that kind of money you could afford a mortgage couldn't you
That's it
There about s anyway
Yeah it's it's not much more
And Stu art's been and enquire d and it wouldn't be much more for a small property
When the market lifts then you'd
That's it
There's not a lot more in here is there
There's a bedroom it's very
They don't make them any more do they
No
They call this the bedroom do they or
Yeah
I mean it's quite a good
This bedroom's got the bay window
They've got security locks same as ours
Security locks like like we've like we've got at home
Yes
Yeah
can't you
Quite nice
Mm
Don't think
No
Quite like the ceiling s
They're different aren't they
Yeah mm
Quite pretty
You've got er m point behind where you could
Mm
In burgundy
I don't know what other colours they had
But it's reasonably good quality
There's an airing cupboard Probably got a dead body in there
I watch too many mysteries don't I
Cook er goes in there and the washing machine in there
Yeah
Nowhere for a fridge
Well you'd have to have it sticking out round
This is a bit silly isn't it
Not having any room for a fridge anywhere
The cook er would have go in there and the washing machine in there
Washing machine in there
No fridge
No he hasn't thought about it very well has he
I'm afraid it would have to be sticking out
Is it is it a tall fridge
Or is it just an ordinary work top one
No just an ordinary fridge
There isn't a fridge
Well there will be
Just an ordinary one
what the other ones are like
Unless you unless you get the fridge in the cupboard
Oh this is just exactly the same only the other way round
Same the same but opposite
Yeah
in the cupboard
Oh yeah
Oh that's
It hasn't got a sink in this one
It hasn't got a toilet either
Or toilet
It's all been
Er actually it has been broken into this one
Oh no
We looked at it outside and and the window
It looks like it yeah
at the back there is broken
somebody's been helping themselves
fire alarms keep though don't they
Number seven
This is the

Yeah
Yeah you see your washing machine
Cook er that
Oh I see
This is different isn't it
Yeah
Got a bit more space
Yeah
See you could have your cook er one side and your washing machine and fridge washing machine under there and fridge there
So what you've achieved is this piece over the stairs
Yeah
Mm
I said the one upstairs was bigger
Yes
You said it was bigger didn't you
Yeah
I was reading the things and I said it was a bigger upstairs is are bigger than the downstairs
It's better cos the other one's a little bit of an alley isn't it the kitchen
Yeah
Yeah
It's quite pleasant that is
Yeah you see it's bigger cos the bedroom
is a bigger bed bigger room altogether
Goodness
What a difference
Oh there is a difference
No this is the living room
Yeah
This is the living room here
Yeah that's right
This is the bedroom
But even so
But even the bedroom's bigger
Oh c r i key that's a big bedroom too isn't it
It's bigger
Most definitely
Yeah I said
So you'd have
It's a lot better
Yeah
Yeah
I could tell by the you know the details
Financial
it just seemed that
Yeah
The way they were reading
Yeah the way it was reading
I said to Stuart I'm sure
Yeah
the upstairs is bigger
He said that can't be
But you've got the hall and that underneath you see
Yeah it's the landing and everything
Underneath us yeah
Yeah
It would be quite pleasant up here
Yeah
I like this one I don't like the downstairs one so much
No I like this much more
What colour 's the bathroom
the bathroom's even nice
It is isn't it
I don't know why but it just is
Yeah
Yeah I prefer this one definitely
I do
Yeah I do
What's this little cupboard
It's quite big as well isn't it
Yeah
You could put your hoover and ironing board in that
Yeah
Cos they don't think of those things do they
No they never do do they
Yeah I prefer this one to downstairs
It's much better
I do
I do
Yeah
You've also got the loft there you can shove
Oh this one's locked
rubbish
Well that one actually 's not ad ver ti zed so it might have gone
Oh
we've only seen well we've seen ad ver ti zed six five six and seven
Numbers five six and seven isn't it
but that one wasn't
Oh right
That wasn't
well there's no details in
That's probably sold then because if I had a choice of four I would take the upstairs one wouldn't you
Yes
said
Yeah
Let's have a little look how it goes again if I may
Cos I haven't seen
I like the look well I like this one if out out out of all of them
I do
Yeah I do
this is much more much the nicer
I like it very much
Yeah I like it
Much the nicer
As I say you've got plenty of room to have your
there's room
You know you've got your washing machine goes in here the cook er there your fridge here
Yeah
Yeah
You could get it all in there wouldn't you
You'd get every th you'd get your cook er cook er goes there fridge here washing machine under there you're
Yeah
You're away
Plus it's a little bit
Yes it's more
Yeah that other one was a bit narrow and
a bit more elbow room
Yeah
I like this one
Yeah I do
I definitely much prefer this one
And I say the rooms are bigger as well
Yeah it's a good size
Yes they are
Oh yes I definitely like the upstairs to the downstairs
And what number's this
Seven
Seven
Mm
This is much better you can almost see your furniture can't you
There's room to put it in
Yeah that's it
afford this
Yeah
Yeah
any of them
I like this one
I like this one better than the others
Yeah
I definitely
That that
Yeah that's when I was reading the thing I said to you somehow the upstairs seemed much better
Yeah
Cos it's quite a big
It is
It is a nice size bedroom
Have you got
Yes
wardrobe s and dressing tables
So you'd
Mm
Quite pleasant view as well
It is that's it
It's not likely to be over well actually I don't we don't know if they're gonna be building there
Well I think you'll I think you'll find you'll get buildings
Eventually
eventually round the back
It would be a good start wouldn't it
Yeah
Especially if you can get the right price
Well I certainly yeah I certainly like this one
When you say you've had what sort of figures are looking well can you achieve
Do you know
Thirty two thousand
Thirty two and a half maximum wasn't it
Mm thirty two and a half at a push
So really you just wanna get something as cheap as possible and
Yeah
Cheap but nice
Yeah
Cheap as possible but
That's it
you want a bargain
And this one's as I say it's twenty nine something so I mean it's it's about right isn't it
Mm
Yeah and there are all sorts of ways you could
You could either go in with cash
Do you have any deposit at all
No

No
I definitely like this one
The benefit of this one as well is if let's just say we that you knocked him right down on his money force as cheap a buy as possible then ask if you can do a hundred percent
Mm
Providing it's providing it's providing it's not damp
That's right
new roof s and everything
I mean you'd have no problem with this
No
None at all
No problem at all no maintenance at all
Right looks good
It does yeah
Yeah
Alright
I definitely like this one
Yeah
So we could work towards to knock him right down
Cos then obviously when the market lifts it's then that's where you're gonna gain
Gain
Mm
Mm I definitely like this one so
Well it's a good size isn't it
It is
Much better
Surprising really
Only that
Yeah
extra foot more
That's why I said to you
Extra foot or extra few inches isn't it
Yeah
Just makes all that difference
Yeah
Just that extra what eighteen inches
That's all it is in the kitchen
And somehow the rooms downstairs the bay
Yes
Yes because of the bay
Yeah it makes makes that much difference
Yeah
I like the colour best up here
Yes I like the colour better
Another thing you've got a window in the bathroom
Mm
Yeah
Mm
Funny down here it's a dark hole
Yeah down here there's no no
the bathroom's quite nice
Right
I know but in here there's no window at all it's er you've got to have the light on all the time
Don't you
Yeah
It's the way the door is as well
The door in the other flat is here isn't it
Mm
And you've got the bathroom and
Yeah
The bathroom bathroom
are here and th there you've got the kitchen and the lounge
It's turned over
Kitchen to kitchen to the front
And the bathroom's
And I mean you don't really need all that space
It's dark isn't it
It is dark
Mm
Then you have the noise of the fan where upstairs you've got the window
If you have a shower you can
Yeah
let the con dens at i on out
This kitchen's really quite tiny
It's quite but what I'm I mean where would you put your fridge
You don't do you
I mean you've really got to have a fridge in this day and age haven't you
Oh yeah
I mean you can't really afford to take a unit out
No
I mean
No cos then you wouldn't have enough space
And you haven't got
You couldn't have your fridge sticking out here so you could go and to get
No you couldn't do that could you
Somebody hasn't thought have they
No
Cos they've put a separate drawer unit in
Oh yeah
So you can't even lose that cos you lose your drawers
Yeah
Cos this is a double base
Mm
No I think number seven's the one
Yes
I do
It's better than this one
I like that one
like being upstairs wouldn't you
Yes
Yes
Well w we said we'd prefer to be upstairs
Well we prefer stairs
rather than have somebody above your head
And you can make the noise can't you
Also as well
We work we we work shift work so I I mean you know we get up at half past four in the morning and and if you've got people t run d ling about above your heads all hours of the night it's er
Oh god
How are we gonna get out
Er m we're not
Oh
Stuart
Is it a security lock and I'm not turning the key round enough
No you're not
Is is there a key in the
No I've got the keys
No there's no key
Er m
Can you hold it here so it's security keys and I haven't turned it round the other way
Mm
Do you feel like jumping out the window
Oh dear what a pity
Never mind we'll just have to stay here the night
Yeah
Oh well done
Window oh we've done it
I think it just needs a bit of
Maintenance
a bit of something on it just to
Yeah
key
what is it
Something forty
U B forty
W D forty
W D
Yeah
Ah that's it
Oh I wonder if it's going to yeah
It's it's the security thing isn't it
Mm
turn it right round the key it should
Yeah it's not
It needs
It needs just needs a little bit of attention
Just yeah
That's to open it and that's to lock it
Take the key out and that should lock it now
Yes
But now it should yeah it does
Yeah
It's been just lying here
That's now locked
You won't be able to shut it now because of that
Oh right
You could leave it open that way
If you leave it to there then that will click then then you'll be alright
That's handy cos to shut yourself out
No
Not if you've turned it that way cos then you won't be able to
Ours is actually a new house
It was but er the market was so low that he decided not to well I don't think he could get a buyer actually it's just stood there so he he he let it out rather than have it stood there with the option for us to buy it but I say now the prices are lower he's not keen on selling it at that price
And I'm not prepared to go on paying three thousand a year renting it to give to him when I could be buying one myself
Yeah
Mm
I mean three thousand a year to rent one's a lot of money really
Mm
Hall o there
Oh hall o yeah sorry about that
a bath and I was soaking in there for ages
I wasn't quite decent and I thought well I'm not letting people in when I'm not decent
Oh no
I mean please excuse the mess won't you
Doesn't matter
If you'd have let me in I could have washed your back for you
No no no
No I can manage on my own thank you
Fair enough
Fair enough
Right
Sorry to intrude on your on your privacy
That's okay
But er there we are
That's the kitchen is it
Economy seven
it's dark in here
bit sort of dark
Yeah
It's not normally
Nice size kitchen isn't it
Yeah that's alright isn't there
Yes
If you can imagine it without the boxes it
Yeah
Cos you're packing up
for a flat it's er
Yeah
It's a nice size
It's a lovely size kitchen

Oh yes
What act what actually does the price include
Does it does it
That I couldn't tell you
Is the cook er included or not
No

That's
That's that's yours is it
Doesn't doesn't say
It just says a cook er point
Cook er point
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
All the units are obviously
Yes
Yeah
Oh yes yeah
Are they your carpets
No
Okay
And
So the carpets may be as well
So we might get might get the carpets in as well
you'd have to negotiate on that one with Mr and Mr
Yeah
talking about your home
The carpets
Everything that is here is mine with the exception of the carpets
Yes
Right
Shall we go is that the bedroom through there
No that's the bathroom
Oh right
Do you want to come
And is that a store cupboard
That's that's the airing cupboard through there
But it
This is the airing cupboard in here is it
it doesn't air
I'll be honest with you it doesn't air
No
It's er very cold in there
Well it's good good got a well la gg ed tank
Yeah
Which is not a bad
Yeah that is it
That's what he said he had to
That's not a bad thing in a way is it
No
It's better than having the water
They actually took they actually took the front off so that the water would get hotter
Er m and it didn't work and you know
Mm
I thought then I'd be able to use it as an airing cupboard but it still didn't work but it's like you said it's because it's got such a good
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
And it does once you've actually heated the water it keeps hot for so long it's amazing
Ours is like that isn't it
Yeah
Yeah
Where we are now is
We've got a similar one on ours
Yeah
Mm
But it's a good store isn't it
For your ironing board and cleaner and
Yes it's quite large as well isn't it
Mm
Yeah
I I mean you can put anything in there really
Yeah
I mean I did have some of the boxes in there until I sort of thought while I was sorting things out
Yeah yeah
The bathroom
Yeah that's the bathroom in there yeah
Oh it's a nice little bathroom as well isn't it
Oh that's not too bad either is it
No
No it's pleasant
It is isn't it
Yeah
Isn't it

It's quite
Very pleasant
Yeah it's quite nice
Big enough
Yeah
I like the colour as well
Yeah
Yes it's a nice colour
It's a warm colour
Yeah
That's right
Mm
Nice
Yeah this would be terrific
Yeah that's alright
like we've got the quite similar lot
Yeah
Same as we've got at home
we've got already
Feels warm in here as well
Yes
Do you have any problem with the heating
Or
Er m the bedroom doesn't get as hot as I would like it
Yeah
but then I have circulation problems so I do feel the cold
Yeah yeah
Er m but here in the kitchen it's lovely and warm
But but it's quite it's a warm it's a warm
Yeah
I mean that heater is not on full not on full power
That's quite good isn't it
like ours
That's very much like the one I mean ours is on about two or something like that and
Yeah
We have ours on two and it's ever so warm
You go in there in the evenings you know when it's been when it's been off and
Yeah
As I say I mean well because I do feel the cold I suppose I have to have more heat than
Yeah yeah
a normal person but er
Yeah
Quite nice really isn't it
Yeah I like this too
The bathroom's a bit chilly but once you've put that heater on and shut the door for a few minutes it's
Yeah
Yeah
it's lovely
Yeah we've got one like that I know
That's not my art work on there that's my little niece's art work
space under there as well
Yeah there's space under there for bits and pieces
Yeah
And it's amazing actually what you can get under there
Ooh look at this
That's a nice size bedroom
It is a nice size isn't it
Yes
It's
Eh
quite a big bedroom
That's a smashing size bedroom isn't it
Mm it's a very good size
This is where you isn't it
Mm
Oh that's a lovely big bedroom isn't it
Yeah
And you've got the heater here over in the corner as well so it's gonna
Got the heater yeah yeah
air it through
Yeah
Yeah
Cos you don't always want it hot do you
No we don't like it too hot in the bed well Stuart doesn't
He's always well I'm always
cold and he's always boiling
If I have the heat up very high in the bedroom he can't sleep
I'm impressed aren't you
It's ever so nice
Very
It is lovely yeah
Have the o th is there another flat then above this one then
Above
Yeah that's a bit smaller
Yeah the door there isn't it
That's a bit smaller
Mm
Do you hear them at all
Er m sometimes if he's been out very very late and I'm still up and he's come home after a heavy night drinking
I mean I'm not saying he's alcoholic but he goes out with the lads and he you know he'll he'll sort of thud up the stairs
Mm
But then he'll apologize the next day
Man after me own heart
You know I mean other than that no I mean it it's not as if
Yeah I was gonna say same
this one
Oh probably probably
If he goes to the pub Stuart would probably know him anyway
Might do yeah
More than likely
No I mean it it's not as if you hear the telly or
Oh I see these are his stairs
That's the s t airway
That's his stairs yeah
Yeah
Yes
His door's just there isn't it
Yeah
That's right yeah that's
Yes that's his door there and
Yeah
that's his stairs out
But the upstairs one that's the kitchen's a bit smaller
Er m and instead of the bath in the bathroom he's just got a shower up there
probably is wardrobe s there
I must admit I like a shower but then again I do like the chance to have a bath now and again
bath every every now and again yeah
Yeah that's bigger
Er m which is why I went for the downstairs cos I had a choice of either
But I went for the downstairs one because of the bath
Yeah yeah
Yeah be nice
It's nice
It's a nice size
I mean we've just been to look at some others and upstairs and downstairs
But the upstairs one in the other one was was
Was bigger than the downstairs
Hell of a lot of difference really it's surprising just a
Yeah
I mean I must admit I've looked at some other flats
Er m and one I looked at I couldn't believe it
Er m I mean it was a top floor flat
And so I mean you had to sort of go up several flights of stairs and you walked in and it it looked lovely
Thought oh this is nice it er m it ha it hadn't got a separate kitchen it was sort of like a kitchen diner
Yeah
Mm
but it was very big
A studio
Mm
It was very big
I thought oh well this is lovely
Walks into the bedroom well you would have hardly got the bed in there never mind about anything else
And er there was a hand basin in there and when you went into
In in the bedroom
In the bedroom
Yeah
When you walked into the well what I would call a cupboard but they class ed it as the bathroom
You'd got the toilet there and behind the door I mean you had to sort of squeeze yourself and shut the door and behind the door was a shower
You're joking
No shower curtain mind you
Even so no room to swing a cat
Terrible
It was terrible
Yes
This is nice though
I like this
Yeah I like this one
Very much
Yeah it's a nice just a nice size
Do you know who the build er is
It says here local building
Er m well no all I know is Bates and Da c k but they didn't actually but I mean yeah they put it together
They they renovate d it
They they they
That's right yeah
They renovate d it
they re rev amped it or whatever
allocated parking
You just park in the road or
No no there's the grave l down
There's a space down
the side is for parking
Oh good
So you've got your own bit
Oh yeah
Yeah this one I mean upstairs hasn't but this one has
And is there anything there I mean can you dry your clothes out there at all
No
There's no line
Can't get over the size of this though
I think I'd probably put my wardrobe s on his on the sta i r wall
That would dampen it a bit wouldn't it
Mm
Nice
I like it
It's lovely and warm
Very nice
yeah
What is your situation
I mean are you renting the flat
Yes
Yeah
So how much notice do you have to give
Er a month
I'd like you to give me a month
Thank you very much indeed for showing us your home
Thank you very much
I'm sorry to bother you
If you can hear next door's music I can assure you it's not a regular occurrence
And if you tell him about it he tu he's in a rock band
Er m now and again he pr act is es but he usually tries to do it when I'm not here but er m not
seem quite friendly then
Yeah
Well we we work shifts so he could probably do it when we're on ear lies and
Well that's right yeah
And when we're on late s he can do it at
Yeah if you let it I mean you know he's fair like that
If you let him know
We're not really in that much anyway are we
No
No
We work long hours and
Thing is don't you find in th in this sort of environment if you've got you know if they're nice people you all communicate don't you
Yeah you can do things like that
And that can work to your favour because if ever you have a problem then you know
Yeah you can talk and
That's right
Yeah I mean that's the same as I di I must admit I did have sort of an argument with him once over his music
We fell out for a little while but I mean playing loud but I mean upstairs is fine
And next door to him number five they're an elderly couple er m and they've got one of their sons living there at er m he's disabled in some way but I'm not quite sure how
Mm
But they are very very friendly
Very friendly they are
Mm
I suppose some people might say to them oh you're being nosy but then that doesn't bother me because you don't tell them what you don't want them to know
No
That's right
But it's nice because if ever you're poorly then it's in your welfare isn't it
That's right yeah
They keep an eye
They do tend to keep an eye on me anyway
Neighbourhood watch
It's well there is a Neighbourhood Watch Scheme down here

Oh yeah you could have a taller fridge
Fridge fridge - f r e e z e r up there or against that window couldn't you
Have it away from that
I like them like that because what I tend to do with so I like them that big because then I can cut them up into sticks stick them in the fridge then if I feel like being naughty not ever so naughty because I'm nibbling at carrots rather than a packet of crisps or something
But they're a nice aren't they
Oh yeah and I mean that sort of size
Yeah

Yeah
The upstairs one
And we can get a good package on that you see
How do you mean
Well he he's wanting to sell them
Yeah but I mean what do you
And he'll either you can either knock he'll ei you can either knock some money off which he'd accept what ev mo most or he'd pay your deposit for you
Oh
And what's that
Well I'm if it's full price thirty thousand that's three thousand pound inn it near enough
Yeah well fifteen hundred
Five percent is
Fifteen at five percent
Oh he'd pay fifteen hundred for you
What
Or or he'll knock it off the price if you want to
Oh

You can get a good deal with him because
Yes
he wants to get he wants them sold now he's built them

No that's true
That's true
okay
Bye
See you
Bye
See you tomorrow
There we go
Is that better dear
Yeah
That's lovely
Shall we have a nice cup of tea
I was gasping
Especially when that man was
Rabbit ting
Yeah which I didn't understand any of it
No
Pension mortgages and this mortgage and and he didn't really know how er er cos that that foreign Lucy or whatever her name was
Yeah
that foreign lady was quite amused
She was laughing when you were asking him questions
Oh
as if to say ah ah he's not sure what he's doing
He's got somebody here who knows
Instead of just sitting there and quoting all these figures
yeah
and blinding you with science
Yeah
Somebody who can ask questions and knew what he was talking about
Yeah
And she was giggling away
She kept raising her eyebrows and laughing
I was watching her
Well I couldn't see her cos I had my back turned
No you had your back to her
Yeah
But I could see behind you and she was
Well there you are
When you do know a bit about it you yes you want to know
Well that's it
You're not and you're not gonna be blinded by all these like he was what was he saying about all endowments are are not unit then you were saying yes they are and
I didn't know what on about there
I I think he got his
said that
Oh he knew what he was talking about but
But you were confusing him because you knew where he's used to just sitting there and telling blah blah blah blah and
Well you see the thing is they they they
And you knew what he was on about
they quote this unit linked business
Now it's all
And you didn't want that did you
well and good a unit linked policy but as I said to you before that if they if the market crashes the day before your policy is due out you
And you haven't got enough money
you could you can lose a th I don't want one
If the market crashes the day before you take your policy's due to mature wallop
You can lose a lot of money in a you know just like that
But do you think this thing what he was on about pension mortgage do you think that would be better
Was that that PEP thing what's all in the papers at the moment
No
Is that what it means
PEP 's different
Oh
Is it similar
PEP 's a personal equity plan
Oh
Sorry
Which is different
To be perfectly honest in my current situation
M hm
a pension mortgage would be more advantage o us
Well that's the most important thing isn't it
At the moment
Because well I'm not in a pension scheme at work
But I have got an option to go in it
Yeah
if I want to
M hm
Er m the only problem is welleven s even not so much now because because the er a bit better
Because of the m because of the way pensions and that are are organized now they're more flexible now I mean you can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension scheme you were obliged to go in it that was it
All your other arrangements went up went through the window
Mm
Er m so it it it it's difficult
Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays can't you and into a
You can now take now now now you can take them with you
Mm
Where they used to be frozen and then you started another one wherever you went next time
That's right
That's right
Whereas now
And you ended up with three four d silly little bits and pieces didn't you
Yeah
Yeah
Whereas now you see all the they can put them all into one
Yeah
I know you can take them with you now
Mm
So in a way I think
And it was a lot less money as well wasn't it
I mm yeah but that w don't forget
It started
that was sixty five
Yeah
The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true they double every five years
Particularly in the later years there's you know
Mm
more And that's why I said when it sounded so low that's why I I still doubt his figures
I still think two hundred pound a month a thirty thousand pound mortgage it's too low
And and a cash sum at the end of it
Still think it's low
Seems quite doesn't seem a lot does it
No
I'm pretty certain
And would you still have to have an insurance on top of that
You have to have term assurance
So you'd still have to have
You'd have
you'd have the two hundred pound and then you'd have a life insurance on top
No no no
No
That was it two hundred and twelve pound
The whole lot
The whole lot
Well why doesn't everybody have them then
Because not everybody's eligible for them
I know but they didn't he didn't suggest it to you or why doesn't he say well there is this er er you said that he didn't
And he must have known that they're gonna be cheaper so why doesn't he advise people who are starting out to take one of them
Didn't ask
Rather than a
Didn't ask the questions
I know exactly
But surely that's
He didn't he
his job
If he's trying to find you the cheapest
He's not doing his job
Basically
Exactly
he's not doing his job
Because a young couple going in well even in our situation you haven't got much money and you want the cheapest thing for the best we you know
But he never suggested it
You said what about a company what about a a pension mortgage and he
He didn't he he didn't ask the question
Which he should have asked
Mm
Exactly
Yeah because it is cheaper and
You see the thing is you see I mean wh wh when this law came out LA UT RO and all that business came out that and best advice and all this sort of thing you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing
What they've got insurance already er m so on and so forth
And arrange around those circumstances the best advice package
Mm
But he didn't ask me the questions
He just he just he just
No he just could do an endowment one and that was it
he just assumed it was gonna be
An an endowment policy and endowment mortgage and that was it
He didn't tell you anything else
No
Well you see when he said your base is gonna be
I know
a hundred and two hundred
Ninety six
and fifteen pounds or whatever
Two hundred and five and then that on a ninety six
And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a first time buyer
Mm
That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six for the first year
Then it goes back up to the base rate
Yeah
Not I know all that's that's obvious
That's quite clear
Mm
But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a pension mortgage I thought well if a hundred and ninety
That's only five pound a month to earn your pension
if a hu if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how come you don't
That gives you five pound a month towards your pension which is nothing is it
how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with because of the term assurance on top
That's fourteen pounds a month term assurance
Quite high I think
What's term assurance
Don't understand that
Term assurance is life insurance just on life only
With no cash sum at the end
Well if you died you'd be dead
Well that's fair enough isn't it
You wouldn't want anything else
But er throughout throughout the term of my life
And if you died the would be paid
If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable
That's it you'd pay
But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high
Term assurance
I'm tempted I'm I'm I'm tempted to have a word with Mick
What and arrange your own
Well
Or he'd just tell you
well I whether I I don't know whether he would or whether he wouldn't
I mean he might he might not but then again he might
He might if I if I talk to him he might tell me what sort of I don't want to hassle him you see cos I've hassled
No that's it
him before
Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort of thing and I don't wanna I'd like to know
Mm
I'd like to know before you know
You've got to get the right deal
Yeah
I I did two hundred and one pound a month or two hundred and fi ft okay it sounds cheap but I don't know fourteen pound a month just for li thirty thousand pound life cover over suppose it's the
Yeah but that's not that much a we
I suppose it's the term of years
It's only three quid a m a week
Yeah but I suppose it's the term of years as well
You sort of to sixty five rather than at sixty
Well that's it
So that probably makes it but I say without having me own book to check it I can't
Mm
I can't tell you
You see you can you get a lot you can get tax relief off that or you used to be able to get tax relief
Well he said you could get tax relief on the whole lot
On the whole lot yeah
That's what he said
At twenty five percent
At twenty five percent
I think you still I'm not sure whether they've changed the law round or not cos they
Well that's what he said didn't he
Yeah
Er you'd be handy for a a tax relief on the whole lot rather than just
Yeah
part of it
Cos that you see if you if you if you could link up life assurance to your pension you could get tax relief on your life assurance you see
Mm
Which makes it advantage o us because there's no tax relief on life policies now as there was
There used to be yeah
There used to be but there is no
But they stopped it
there is they stopped it
There isn't any more
Mm
No I'm sort of I think he confused himself as well as confusing me slightly
Yeah be because you you confused him
Yeah
Because you knew
Mm
Rather than somebody as I say like me who sat down there and he'd just quote all these figures and you wouldn't know what the hell he was on about and just all you all I would understand at the end is that's what you gotta pay
Mm
Which is what most people that go in there
Are interested in
Well they wouldn't understand all the rest
This plan that plan the other plan
They only know well you either have this option paying this amount that option paying that amount or that option paying that amount and which one do you want to have
Mm
And and you don't understand any of the rest of it
No
No
You just sit there mm yeah mm no mm well that's the cheapest that's the dearest and and take their advice which ones the best for you and have it
And that's er that's all normal people who don't understand any of it that's the way they'd go about it isn't it
Yeah
You'd just accept whatever was
See the other thing I don't know well no I'm not sure you can now
See if I took a pension mortgage out it would be linked to me lumped into me current pension contract
Cos I've already got a pension scheme running
Cos I've contracted out of SER P S
And also got er m er m what used to be called seventy seven
Yes Stuart
Er m a frozen pension with the Pr u
Yeah
linked in with it at the moment
That's that's that's my pension arrangements at the moment
Mm
Mm so I'm tempted er if I'm gonna do a pension
I tell you what you wa who you wanna go and see
Who I saw when I bought the house at er thing
Now he was I know he blinded me with science but he wa he was really very good and he had his computer there and he went through all these different societies and plans
Well that's what he's done
You see that's what he's done
No but he had I mean he had a screen and er
Mm
and that was that's along near Maxie's near the post office but it's a
Yeah I saw him
Oh the er m the Scots chap
Er what's his name
Oh and he was smashing
And he explained it all to me
Oh I can't think of his name now
I I I have had dealings with him
He he explained it all
Yeah
And although there was all these figures and er and he explained what was best I mean he was purely a financial I mean he he as he said when we went in cos it doesn't make no difference I I I'm not attached to anything
I'm here to
No
But no r's he
I am here to give you advice
That's it
And that's it
Independent financial advice
And and therefore I'm not here to sell you this or that
I'm here purely to find out you want to buy this council house and and and I'm here purely to find out your circumstances and and what would be the best deal for you
That's right
And he went I mean I was there for bloom ing ages
And he went through everything till he found out and it wa I didn't have the abs the absolute cheapest one
Cos he didn't think that was a because Steven was disabled and that as well and on my money and one thing and another
Yeah
and and one thing and another but er it I mean mi mine ended up with the Bradford and B ing ley I mean
Yeah well they're agents for Bradley Bradford and B ing ley
Yeah I know but he did say that even though agents I'm not giving you this and then he showed me all the things you know to sort of prove that he was doing it
But that's wh oh yeah that's who I had
Yeah
It doesn't matter what building society you go to
No well that's what he said it doesn't but I mean he went through all these and insurance companies and because of my kidney being removed I had to pay I had to pay higher even though I didn't have to have a bloody medical but I had to pay high because of my
Yeah
Medical condition
because I'd had medical Yeah it was cos I'd had all these operations
You know you had to put how many operations have you had in the last ten years and have are you er receiving any treatment and all that bloody blah blah blah
And so mine mine was higher
Yeah
than er than other peoples which is why he went to all these bloody quotes
See the thing yeah
As I say the thing the thing is as I say it's you you your m or
He sorted it all out
But he was really good
Yeah
Your mortgage it doesn't matter who your mortgage is with basically
I mean you can go to most places and
Mm
you're gonna be paying
But when you buy a council house it is slightly different in as much as some some of them won't have them
Oh yeahyeahyeah
Then also he also gave me I mean I got hundred percent mortgage which you are allowed on I mean the law says er t the chance to buy so therefore you don't have to have a deposit
But he also gave me enough to cover all my fees legal fees
Yeah
Yeah
So I borrowed over what the house was worth
But that was only because I'd lived in it for a long time and I got a discount so the house was really
Discount
Yeah
worth more
Yeah
than what I was paying for it
Yeah
Cos I got a discount so er I borrowed another thousand pound
To cover your costs
to cover all the costs for the survey for Maxie's and and this that and the other
Which I think come to about eight nine hundred pound
Mm
As I say it doesn't matter what building
Anyway he borrowed all that for me
it doesn't matter what building society you go to you're gonna be paying basically the same rate
Because they're all the same rate
The base rate's the same
You okay one place you can get a percent discount you might get a percent and a half discount depending on your
Mm
depending on the building society at the time
It's the life policy
Mm
that makes the difference
But to go to somebody like him who knew his job
Mm
which was his job and and had everything there and he he patched through to this computer this place and different computers that he had
Yeah
Yeah
And the facility to to get through to
Mm
Mm
That he could get all these to find out what he thought was the best policy in in your
Mm
as I say because of my health and one thing and another you couldn't just and he and he was really good he was and explained everything to me I say that
Can't think of his name now but I know the chap
He was a tall chap with glasses
Mm
Yeah
Yeah
Ever so nice
Yeah
He really you know made me feel I say I weren't sat there like I was with that fella thinking well he don't seem to know what he's saying anyway
No no
Which is what the impression I got about him he wasn't really sure himself
Mm
But I think that was partly you floored him because you knew
Yeah
Yeah
He sort of was a bit you got him a bit couldn't say
But certainly that man that I went to that time he was very very nice and
Mm
then you could see he'd patch into all these different bloody things and
Mm mm
and and and I ended up with er a reasonable
Was yours an endowment
Or just
It was an endowment
Yeah it had to be
I dunno why but it had to be
Mm
Well I don't know but that's what
When does your mortgage finish then
My mortgage
I had it in eighty one twenty years so another ten years
So in fact there's still an endowment policy on you to cover that mortgage
No they were all cancelled weren't it
I dunno
Oh yeah I signed the form
So your endowment policy
Everything's all
Ended
Yeah
Cancelled
Cancelled
Stopped
Well what about the money
The money was all
I don't know
I just signed forms to say that I was no longer responsible or had any claim on the property or whatever
And that was it
I didn't have to pay any more and I didn't and I was passing it over to to Steve
I don't know what happened
Yeah but what about the The life policy was in your name
The whole lot was in was it endowment
No I dunno it can't have been can it
I don't know
No it wasn't it was a no it wasn't an endowment
I didn't pay
I only paid extra insurance
Oh just a straight term p policy like I was
Yeah because yeah because because of my health
Yeah
Yeah
That was it
Yeah it was Yeah
Because of my health
It was a term assurance rather than it being an endowment insurance
Yeah
I couldn't I don't think he could get the other he got that one because of i in my health you couldn't they couldn't say how long
Mm
because of my kidney
The other kidney could go all blah blah blah and this that and the other
Yeah
It was just ordinary insurance
I don't know how much it was
I don't know
I mean I only paid a hundred and sixty pound a month but I mean
Mm
Then I only borrowed twenty odd thousand cos I got a forty odd percent discount off the price of the house anyway
Mm
Twenty two I think it was something like that
Mm
You see
And the rent was thirty six pound a week
And it ended up I was buying it for less money than what I was paying monthly for rent
Yeah
Well you would do
So it was all
It was worth it
Might as well have done it
Mm
Mm
So I went into it
Mm
Mm
Yeah it it worked out hundred and sixty one pound a month with the insurance
So it's alright I mean I paid the whole bloody lot to them I didn't
Mm
sort it all out
You don't pay it separate I didn't
I paid to council offices
Mm
And they sorted they forward it I suppose or did whatever they had to do with it
Mm mm
Used to pay at the council offices
different book
used to go and pay it
Write the cheque out and he'd just take it in
Mm
I could have had it done through the bank but he was always up town anyway so
Mm
So it didn't make any difference
didn't make any difference one way or the other
Mm
Mm
So how about you
You'd have it done through the bank anyway and I'd just pay you weekly I cou might as well rather than monthly
Mm
Save you going to the bank
Couldn't I
Just give you the money you spends
We'll see when we come when it comes down to it won't we
What we could do financially
And sort something out then
Well of course we will
expect you to pay
But I cer t I I I I I ju I it it just sounds you know two hundred pounds a month just over two hundred pound a month
Sounds smashing dunn it
Sounds wonderful
That's what I said why doesn't everybody have them
Well that's why I can't believe it
Well he said go back and tomorrow at least and
And check his figures
M hm
If that's right that's the one you want really isn't it
Well I I I yeah
I mean obviously I'd have to pay more er for if I want it to end at sixty
Mm
But even then it won't be will it be that much
To get to get a higher lump sum
To get a higher lump sum
But then you see
Would it be that much more
Shouldn't think so
Well exactly
So it's gonna
You see it's
be less than a want two hundred and eighty
Oh yeah
I said so you might as well have that and have a lump sum and a bloom ing house and
And a pension
And a pension
That's what I mean
Might as well have your pension
when you get to sixty
Mm
Say it's only twenty six years and course with a pension see you can increase your contributions
Yeah
If if you get a better job and what have you you can always
Better job or whatever or pay rise or whatever you can increase
Yeah you
your contributions into your pension plan
Exactly yes
and still and finish your mortgage earlier
Yeah
Fifty five
Mm
Or fifty
Depending on how much you wanna pay
Mm
If you wanna pay more into it
But I still think
Well see what he comes up with
See what he comes up with yeah
See what he comes up with
And certainly say two hundred and twenty five pound a month it's still worth having
It's cheaper than we're paying now isn't it
Mm
Even if it's two hundred and fifty it the same
Well you'd still
you're gonna have a pension and and a home
In a way I'd rather pay the same and finish the mortgage earlier
Yeah well that's it
You could volunteer to pay two hundred and fifty a month couldn't you
And pay a higher pension policy
M hm
That's what I mean
And then and then you've got the option then you've got the further option that if you want to reduce your premium s on your pension you can do
If anything happened
Mm
If anything if if it does You see again and then you see if you're out of a job you see you if you happen to be out of a job then you're not eligible for a pension policy
What happens then then
If you get made redundant
Well
And you've already got it
Wellthen you have to freeze it
See that's that's the o th that's another drawback with the pension
Whereas an endowment policy it doesn't matter
You you can carry on paying an endowment policy
So it you know there's pros and cons either way
Mm
There's there's er pros and cons in buying either of t ho either of the flats
You see er that's the thing isn't it
M hm
But you've got to make the decision cos I like both of them very much
I do
So therefore you have to make the decision which one if it comes down to it would you like to live in
I mean if we could get that one down at New Drove what is it twenty nine
So that's gonna be say if you get fifteen hundred off it it's gonna be twenty eight
Call it it's thirty thousand isn't it
Yeah
What is it twenty nine nine nine five
You might as well call it thirty thousand
Well say you get twenty eight and a half
You're gonna get it cheaper the m or the monthly payment is cheaper
And then af f and then you could afford to buy some bloom ing carpets
And with the other one you've got to find a deposit which you'd have to pay back
But you wouldn't have to buy any carpets
You wouldn't have to buy the carpets
And you say we'd gonna have to have a cook er and a fridge and that aren't you
Well a cook er you definitely a fridge say we could perhaps borrow that one of mum's until we could afford one
Or pick up a cheap one
Unless I say if you knocked him down
But a cook er's no problem because I know you can go into the Electricity Board and say I'm moving into a new property I haven't got a cook er and they would you can get them
No deposit just added to your electric bill
That's a way to because
Oh buying it on some sort of
Oh yeah on er er a financial agreement
Or look around and see what there is going in the in the market
And get a sort of
Second hand one
no percent free credit
Yeah
I mean there's no difficulty in getting a cook er
Say if we I mean if if we're paying say two hundred pound a month on a mortgage
Mm
for twenty eight thousand
We've got fifty pound a month we can play with and we to buy
Well that's it
You could
to buy a cook er over the ne
I might have one before I go home
Oh
a wine
No
Cup of tea
Mm no no
I'll have a I might have a slim l er bacardi before I go home
Just one
I
You can have a diet coke bacardi won't hurt you will it
It's not fattening
Mm it's still extra calories
I shall be drinking some tonight no doubt and and eating
What do you want bitter lemon
Yeah please
Ice
Yes please
I shall be partying tomorrow night

Ten

Did I put me king the ten
Yeah that's what that's what
Yeah
But I wanted some of me boxes as well I suppose
Oh so I done it wrong
Well it's not what I would have done
But actually
but there you go
I've got six in the box
That's what I would have done but
But I didn't know you see I
Course not no
I couldn't work it out
I think I would have been tempted to do that
I didn't know whether to put two blue queens in or ten things or
Mm
Yeah
a king and queen
In which case had both
Oh it's like that is it
M hm
My box
Oh god
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter who goes first
Who goes first if you win the toss
Shirley says
What
Heads or tails
Tails
I can't score I'm useless at maths
Oh bloody hell
It's impossible I can't do it
And them two go together them two go together and them two go together
All of them go together and these two are a pair
Well what can I say
Exactly
I'm useless at maths
Now don't get too many balls down too many holes at once
I'll have to take a chance won't I
Mm well that's up to you isn't it
Play

No you're not cos I didn't know what to put in the box
You did right
And bought it
Oh yeah not right for me
No
I'd have been better off keeping that one two
I had two sixes two queens one two
Well I didn't know
Here you are I've got your two queens and hope for your turn up or you put your one to it
Simple as that
The queen six and hope for turn up
That would split split your hand up totally
Mm that's why I was yeah
Yes well I didn't know you see
If I don't like playing singles easy as doubles because you only have to put one in and it's easier
One in yeah
He's not a gentleman

Kept jack queen three and three two
Your box dear
Yeah and I would have got nothing
Four
Oh yeah
You would have had four
Oh admittedly you would have been pig sick when a king would have but even if the king had turned up you'd have still got the got a run and fifteen
Ace turned up you'd have got the run four turns up you get your runs
Ten turns up another jack queen
Well I've done didn't do it right did I
So there hadn't got any turned up

Oh now I'm definitely not giving you nothing
It's your box
Cos I've got a straight run through
It's your box
Seven six five four three
It's your box
Well how I don't bloody well know what to put in it
I haven't the faintest idea look three four five six seven eight
No question
Easy
Oh well it weren't to me cos I probably would have given you the eight
No my it's your box
Try a nine
You know what I've got now anyway so it don't matter
Oh no I would have played the nine anyway
Twenty five
Don't talk about it do it
Two four
Six tens
What are you up
Are you gonna do
Box
Two in there so
Oh you're putting
It's no quite easy
Then you've got the four three four five six seven eight and it's your box play the seven
They're the same suit they're close they'd score
If it'd been my box yeah it's eight three
But your box you you gotta keep four five six because any four any five or any six you can
Well yeah but I I'm alright now
I'm cos I can see balls in front of me
Yeah right
So you've gotta keep your four five six and I say it's your box seven eight has got to be the
It's very easy this
Gotta be
Easy
So we'll try and lead Al with that one again

Do you know what I mean
and the whole place you know the ladies lo o s were like er as even a five star hotels you know ha wonderful it was I couldn't believe it
takes longer to get in there
Oh yeah there was lots of foreigners Americans and foreign people there all with maps out on the tables trying to find their way round York which I knew that Stuart knew so it wasn't too bad for us but there's loads of people you know thought how do we get to this from here and well it's certainly a a an experience
It was er Drunken here
Is there no more bitter lemon
Oh yeah they're scurrying the cellar for some We've found two more for you
Thank you
Enough to keep you going all night
It's inn it
M hm
And it doesn't say it has to be other people here probably not every bit of it
Mm
but
Some of it
Mm
Mm
I can't do much about that I mean you can't go sticking in other people's noses
No that's true
Oh wrong way round two kings two eights
Two tens
That's it that's all you got
If I take penny there then that will all make forty pence okay
You're not taking all that money are you
You'll start getting back nownow you're back to your last four pence when it comes down you start getting back don't you
Oh what do I want here
Oh I don't know whether I wanted that Bloody hell
One twothree on the bounce three six eight jack what's that supposed to be
And a pair of tens jack queen king Feel alright
Bloody man I don't want to see that it's got three on it
Oh boys on it
Well here are one twothree on the bounce and I thought well you know that's a fairly good start jack queen king king high was a bit dodgy you never know do you
Oh I've got a handful of bloody pairs here wait a minute got fo I've only got three feels like a bloody handful of them
Can't do nothing here Ain't got nothing there
Is that what you're playing
Well I have to I ain't got nothing else
Three fours eight nine ten queen high the pairs stuck at the end though dear
Oh not one flush
Must of been
Yeah but then it split the bloody pairs all in bits
Yeah I know I know yes
Couldn't make a lot with that could I really
Not really no
there for three pairs which was just as well I stopped you on the last one
Ooh
Ooh
You bugger
Oh I want card for run and I bet I can't bloody do ow t with this lot
No neither can I
Can't even bloody hell
Ain't got eight ha ha
Nope No how's it going
I don't bloody know how to play
Wanna play onetwothreefourfive six and haven't you
Yes
Or five six seven and that's what you wanna do inn it
Oh yeah
No no I wouldn't do that I always do it like this if I was playing that hand three flu well you could go well you got a choice you can go take a chance on your last hand not getting through or you can go twothree fivesix seven two three four ace finish them which is what I'd probably do
Oh I didn't see that oh
One more try
I didn't see that love
three queens jack flush ace high so I mean you wouldn't get any it anyway
I didn't see that last flush I couldn't ba I couldn't sort them out
Yeah but I mean it's it makes you one twothree you wouldn't of had a one two three to start with
I know that
but you had a eight to finish with which is finishing and a one twothree might not be and a better run so I think I would have been tempted to finish with the ace flush there try and stop me rather than trying to win it cos you had nothing else did you
No you didn't have you didn't have a finishing hand you didn't really have a brilliant first two hands and then the pick of the one twothree bounce r I might I might have been persuaded to play the one twothree bounce r and hope that that got through but to finish with an ace flush but good
Oh I don't know I ain't got nothing
Neither have I
Oh I'm not playing this bugger it
You chose I can't sort it out I ain't playing no more it's damn boring

What one
What do you want
I'll have a Bacardi now please one before I go home
the diet
Yes please
I'm trying to be very good but er I can only so much of that
You don't oh you you don't like orange cos that makes you
I'm allergic to it
allergic to it
You alright mate
I heard
Oh eh it comes across my shoulders
Oh I get it all over terrible
No it comes across my it don't come out on my arms or anything it comes it comes on my body if I have an orange
Mm
er a proper orange
I can't touch orange
I love them
I love
Luckily I'm not over
I love
keen
I love a piece of orange I I wouldn't eat a whole orange but I do like er little pieces of oranges now I might get away with that but if I was to have a whole orange
I just get if someone
No
if you sat there peeling an orange and some of the juice squirted on me I'd I'd blister
Mm
Sore it gets
Eighty five
I wouldn't dare eat them I'd be in a terrible state
Yeah I'm like that but we had a er m con i fer type tree it was only so big but and then I and when we we was unloading off the van this come off and I dug a hole and stuck it in the garden in the front garden just by the pathways right that's that but I was washing the car one day a nice hot day got my shirt off when I come in course I'd brushed past it I'd got patterns of the leaves on my on my back
Yeah
I mean my mate he went to hospital cos they said he was allergic to something and they was putting him in a thing that only
Yeah
a little box
Yeah same as
this
and lumbered it
I know a little boy who had that
Yeah

and all the way down his back
Yes
you know and of course one or two did
Yeah
come out you know one or two were leaves and you could see the shape of the leaves well that was just like me on my on my back
Funny inn it
Funny yeah
It's years since I've dared have an orange yeah if I eat an orange I'd damn well
Mm
get blister s over me wherever it touches try and eat one I'd have them on my tongue and in my mouth and everywhere
Just daren't touch them
Well I'm the same I'm alright with you know that orange juice
Yeah
Bri t vic orange juice I'm alright with that mind you I'll only only have one orange juice and lemonade s I'm alright with that alright with an orange drink
Only look what I've er
but
I probably could it depends if it's got real orange in cos when I went to work at Lock woods at Lyme stock
Mm
we had some carbon a ted drinks factory I said well they they asked me if I'd go over there and I said I can't work in there I'm allergic to oranges and he said oh bloody or I've never seen an orange don't worry you know it's all chemicals
Orange flavour s that's about as much as what we'd ever get in here
There's no bloom ing so I mean I could drink something like that which is purely chemical and never seen as li a damn orange That's all it is is flavour ings and water and
Mm
sugar and
Yeah well that you see is just orange
But yeahbut the pure orange I wouldn't dare to touch Cos they're some of them canned orange drinks are
Yeah
are not orange they're all
Yeah but I mean real oranges but you peel them and I'd
Yeah
be bad that I'd come
that's it
out in a rash
And if someone just squirted just
but
squirted on that would be it
you know those orange drinks which it says real oranges in nine times out of ten it isn't there's always some add itive s and what have you
Yeah
because I used to have when I used to go around these for breakfast I'd always have an orange juice and my cereal and then my fried breakfast it's the only time I'd eat a fried breakfast
It's the only time Stuart does if they're away
Yeah
He loves it but he wouldn't have one at home
No
I've offered him I mean it's not as if
Oh right
it's not there but he just won't
Yeah I
he says no I can't it's a special and when you're on holiday it's different you can sit down and enjoy it
Well when you're on holiday
and relax and
Yes I mean when we we went on a
and er if you're going to work or something you don't er
well we went on a course for a week up Newcastle and of course er er m we had to be there for nine o'clock so we had to catch the bus at the latest half past eight so you're up at you're up at seven and you get showered and what have you cos there's a shower in the be bedroom get yourself all ready so you're down by about er m half seven quarter to eight like so you tend to think quarter of an hour to the er m bus stop which is right outside the door of the hotel we were getting so and we use the bus rather than take the car in daily cos it's easier so I and er and of course I sat down and had a breakfast and I thoroughly en jo I didn't have any cereal s you know I says well er and I had a little bit of orange orange juice but it was this er m made up orange juice
Yeah
you know had some of that and er m my fried breakfast and my toast and my cup of coffee and I thoroughly enjoyed that set me up for the day that did
He does when they're on holidays
Yeah
stay and have b rea
and then at lunchtime er first day we went out for lunch somewhere but er m
Didn't really want it
not really want it a a couple of sandwiches or something to be going on
Yeah but
er m but actually near the er m near the bridge the the large round about before you go over the Gates head bridge er m underneath that there's a subway and what have you there's shops in there there's a little shop in there that th that used to do these rolls and beautiful rolls any bread you wanted any filling you wanted you know they have vast variety of different filling s you know and it was all there in these er m show cases and we used to go down there and get a sandwich take it back to to the place where we was you know this conference centre and er m it was great and then course when we got back
we got back there was a a a meal there by the time we'd you know
Brought it in
and what have you come down for a meal and we used to sit with the landlord having a having a nat ter whilst having a few few drinks and er yeah he he used to say er when we went up what do you fancy tonight
Anything you fa you fancy
No we'll leave it entirely up to you and i it wasn't English I think he was Polish or or you know and er m some beautiful meals there was a stew that he did and it was beautiful and we we told him
Oh yes
we enjoyed that what was it
And he I can't remember what it was now but he told us and er m a couple of days later he says er m when we went out he said what do you fancy tonight
Don't mind bu wouldn't mind some of that sweet
Sweet ha ha ha ha
couldn't get hold of that actually
Oh
He went all over the place looking but he couldn't get hold of it I mean it was obviously it was something that he made himself but it was beautiful
He was local to the are a I think it was one of these baker s that used to used to do it but er he probably only used to do it once a week sell it once a week I think of all the people that was on course we got the best we got the best place and er and it came out that the er m tourist information book let
Mm
Yeah somebody had told us about a place to go to asking the bloody earth they were
Yes I
Wh whe where we go in York s hire that Stu Stuart usually gets them out of the Cameron the the pub one where we go and stay and or they're dealing with you know what he's like with his deal he knows if it's there it's usually good fun so you know
Yeah yeah Well he wasn't he used to be licensed
Oh
but he let it lapse because
So
he says I you try buying
I'd just as soon stay in a small pub
Yeah well he used to find that a lo
rather than whole sale outlet
a lot of the people used to come in and they'd be in in his hotel boozing rather than being at the pub you know he says it for me I got a bottle and everything there
Well like Black Bull at Borough bridge you mean
I mean I know it's a beautiful old pub the meals are absolutely wonderful
Mm
But well it was only a pub
Mm
I mean t to for the cooking that they did for a pub it was and we had duckling and salmon poached
Mm
salmon and
Mm
wonderful meals and she she was a real good
Yeah well you see
good cook
if
I mean the only th there was only about twelve or fourteen that she could cater for fo for a meal you know she had her dining room
Yeah
Yeah like we do we
Yeah
Yeah
An tha and that was about it but
Yeah
I mean they were really lovely meals
Yeah well you know I mean we could
look after you so well
we could do it
We could do do things like that
Mm
if there was a call for it round here
Yeah
That most people you know they won't try something like that I mean I know I'm a bit like that myself I'd sooner have a steak
No you see I'd I I'd
Yeah
prefer to try
but yeah and
if I'm going out for a meal I prefer to try something different you can have a steak at home I mean
Yeah
so but I wouldn't go and get salmon
I think the most most people get scampi
or duck yeah and say
Most people have scampi
Yeah
You know they they won't bother with something else
Me I'd rather try something different
Yeah I mean er m
So wh why have so why go out for a meal and and eat something that you
That you can have at home
you can have at home anyway and
Well this is when I go when we go out
That's what I like about
we always we always go to S pal ding well not always but a lot of the time we go to S pal ding and I always have what is called the raw vegetable dip it's all vegetables you name it the vegetables are on there you know carrots er m
Raw
er m mushrooms cabbage and everything's raw completely raw carrots in th in the middle with two different two mayonnaise dips one pl a i s plain mayonnaise and the other half of it is er m garlic flavour mayonnaise and er m that's as a starter I always have that and I thoroughly enjoy it you know that's the by the time I've had that I don't want much of my main meal cos it's great
yeah
plate fu l
I I rather have a
I mean
starter or a
but that is
or
cos Michelle always has their er m p raw n cocktail so there's like a p raw n cocktail
I always have the main meal and the sweet Stu Stuart has a starter and the main meal
But
Cos I I love the sweets see
and then nor
then I ca
Yeah
then I can't if I eat the starter then the main meal I do I can't eat the rest
Yeah well I'm not ove I'm not over struck on some of their sweets that they do you know er m
I love the sweets
the they don't do the same sweets week in week out I mean the they er m they vary them a on a possibly on a on an eight week basis so it all depends which week you go
Week you go
as to which sweets is actually on that week and if it's one that you don't really fancy well I'm not bothered I'm not bothered about the sweets
No I on a weekly then you might have four or five dishes on it
Yeah
and then the next week she'll have
Mm
you know another lot
Well if you
I mean she does everything you know burgers you know stuff that people want I mean that's bar meals but to sit in the dining
Yeah
room you have
Yeah well basically
proper meals
ours basically what you wa what you what is set up there basic bar meals but i you can have it in the restaurant if you want
If you wish
If you wish you know but I mean during the week nine times
So
out of ten
so she did I think it was four se special meals then when we were there there was salmon duckling
at the moment only on a Sunday we get the odd meals on a Sunday we get the odd meals on a Saturday night but nine times out of ten they only want to sit in there there's a
Sit in there
they don't want to sit in the restaurant they very rarely do get them sitting in the restaurant I suppose to a certain extent other than the Sundays it's just waste of space
Yeah
And it's not earning us anything in there but mind you er m it sometimes during the week where er m the tables are full of a load of papers and what have you where I've been doing paper work and that
Yeah
sitting there doing paper work and the ki er m the kids use it as a a an office and what have you there with their paper work Sarah does her homework there and we have our meals in there so er m sort of it doesn't really matter but er you know it saves them all coming out for a meal and having to do it cos trouble is it's too small to keep an eye on people to see if they want anything everything's alright and what have you
Yeah
but you want you don't want the door open because people can go there to the toilet
Yeah
they look in
Yeah
you know and you don't want that when you're eating a meal
When you're eating no
So we shut the door
that's right I know
and you're forever in and out in and out in and out of that it's alright say if we've got somebody in there that was in the
Yeah
kitchen and just keeping their
right
and we can't do that and be in here as well
No
But er I I hope that I mean Shirley as she is she's not cooking but she will cook
She don't want to be
I mean we both can cook if it comes to that I mean I can cook
Stu art's the one for a cook marvellous Stuart is should have been a chef he should smashing cook
Well my mum often used to say that about me
Smashing cook he is
And my brother
I'm not that bad but Stuart can beat me if he gets in the cooking mood
Yeah I like to I like to have a go at different things I mean the the the other the other lunchtime we had you know he came in at lunchtime and er Shirley had gone somewhere Ann and er I'll have the chicken ki ev for me please so so I went and did it did you cook that for him
I says of course yes right he says I really enjoyed he says you know so I mean that made my day that did Daren't tell Sh i r l sh otherwise she'll say you'll do all the cooking
M hm mm
I don't mind but that getting a like when Sh i r l first came she was to get everything done exactly the same time
Same time that's the
So everything's ready same time
Hot and
so it's all hot on the plate and served straight away you know luckily er m I managed it but I got in a little bit of a flap I will admit it whereas Sh i r l's now got used to that I mean I when we first came we both used to do our own help each other out I used to help out but er m
It's getting used to
Well yes yes and Sarah will nip down as well and then Sarah was then getting used to doing she started getting used to doing it and that was it I used to come out and say well no I'll look after the bar from now on and that's it and er
Who won then
Who won Stuart
I I I'm just about to do that
Oh getting a clever devil isn't he
I gotta let him win else he won't play with me
That's it
I was lucky though Ronny did s kitt le though and er
Mm
when he got
and
In case they change their minds again
No
I didn't win no I didn't win I still didn't win
No I know
You're telling me you're playing la he told me he plays in ladies teams I bet you all had great fun watching them women bending over table
Oh we did
Yes that's what that's what I said
Yeah
to him in the
very
tight trousers he kept saying
Yeah well they was cracking
Well they all had high neck
Said he ain't going no more
jumper s
He kept moving round the other side cos they've all got high neck jumper s haven't they Ron
Said he ain't going no more if I find out it's a ladies team that's it he'll be banned
No thank you
Sure
Yeah
then
Changing the subject quick
Oh
Where did you put that red Ron
I put it round here
Yeah see what you can do it's quite a good night actually
Yeah
Ah they they're a laugh they're like this there's one of them to this
Looks like yours
Er she's always and jig g ing about you know but when she plays very still and she hits the ball stands up quick watches where it goes she'll go like this this up jump
Ooh
you know s cat ty as anything
As long as she's
You know
yeah
she doesn't seem the type that would be a school teacher I mean the er m that er m seven eight year old that she teaches and I just think what she's like at school
M hm mm mm m hm
You know I don't know she is she's she's a real nice that's wh well all all them are but you know
there maybe
Yeah they're all nice nice girls you know this is like the other week we was here playing the other team and one of the other team was swearing you know and particularly you know the girls in might have not they have the they used to play for Black Bear and you know the that lady that's up there she still swears and we stopped her from here used to f this f that and f the other we did we stopped her said if you can't find a better word than that to use I shouldn't bother you know As you know Sh i r l don't like that
No she don't
And er
Why should she
Why should
Quite
you put up with it
Yes I just think I mean you get i
I mean it's your home as well as your
Yeah
pub inn it
I mean if a load of fellas in together like Sunday lunchtime
They'd have a fit
if it's all the fellas are in right and I'm in here and Sh i r l's out there cooking doesn't worry me and I don't bother to it because it's good fun isn't it
No that's it
Right
Stuart don't like it in front of a woman
No but as soon as a woman comes in I always say ah language lads ladies present
That's it
well we used to come in here before went and that hasn't been the same at night cos it got a bit so he'd say excuse me love there's ladies present here can't have that
Yeah
Felt the same way and he said as you can see Ann's here we won't be having no more of that
Yeah it's it's
They shut up
it's right though isn't it
I mean why should you have to put up with it
Mind you like I said Stuart I was in the bar and and if I didn't like it I could of gone in the lounge so I mean they couldn't ha he wouldn't have it
More so in here you see
Yeah just cos you're in a a an open
Mm
plan
Yeah
show up
I really like
and said they were sorry you know
Yeah yeah
It'll be alright after that but
I know
they said he was a just a really
Yes
But I mean he ju he just stares at you
I mean it's like when Sh i r l comes through like when Sh i r l comes through you know they know all know Sh i r l doesn't like bad what it means
No
You know I mean we had a woman in pub
so I put her out in the end it er m it was surprising everybody knew what was going to happen they knew what I was going to do right when I come back in after s wi place was empty they'd got out that door before I'd got her out the door but er m no it's it's very insulting
Yeah she should pay for it and all
She'd got thing in her in her er yeah what's what it is up she damaged it ooh some years ago and it's been a bit weak since like you know but sh it was only a few weeks ago we got some computer big computer with big discs and she twisted her hand in in pulling one out you know it's I don't how the fell or something and she went to cash it or whatever and of course we're riding the motorbike for the like you have to change gear it's only a small seat er your bike's open
Yeah
to get up to the thirty five mile an hour you gotta go through all the five gears so you're forever pa going like that er m and that made it worse so that last fortnight she hasn't been on the bike and that last weekend when she went out she went because we was busy she got her bike out and she went up to work one or two of her mates and then come home she said she'd wished she hadn't of gone up
Oh dear
because she was in pain again in had it strapped up again said come and see me in a week see if it's any better but er m she's injured it but not er you know it's obviously she can't move it a lot that way which is what's effecting her but mind you once she gets back on her bike again as it's cold weather
Yeah that won't help
it'll be back again Mind you I feel it I mean I know at the moment it's it's me I my elbows in the morning I can't hardly move them when I wake up in the morning because I get that far my arms have to be outside the bed and our bedroom's that cold
Oh I know
and they kept I was in stiff I could hardly move them I mean if I touched them now I mean that one's not too bad I can't touch that one very much when you can see them my scars and all there If I touch that that'll be very gingerly ach aches like hell
And course we're doing a lot of counting today this wrist is a you know I don't mind that you see what did that wrist was that elbow I had to have a second operation on it in the arm up here because er I had to have some bone taken away in the elbow course it stretched guide r s but they also er m disturbed the wrist joint because it was in plaster like that stretched round and disturbed the wrist joint and I k e it's it weakened it and it's only just it's only just this what last nine months that it's that it's really started to effect this but I know what it is that's because I keep going out doing the odd jobs
Yeah it doesn't help
but I know that if it was really bad I'd just stop doing anything for while for two or three
And you you have a rest
days you see like I was out Monday I was busy all day Monday and then I Tuesday Wednesday Thursday here yet I was busy but it was all brain work
I see
it was all writing
I see
Right and then I I've been out today and I probably won't go out for another four days so I hope I'm alright you know that way it gives me chance to get it right again
Catching up Ron
If
Yeah
I was having to go out daily I couldn't do it
Yeah
I couldn't go out daily
No I know that's what you're waiting for inn it
when you like gotta stop

Right right
funnily enough used
First Friday night

Yeah
Yeah
I mean you liked it at night but I mean we've got people right but some Friday nights we've only got them in that bar
Oh I like Friday night
Or maybe you could have sat in here
few odds and
that's right
but then
then that and he just bring me pack of cards you know er but er that's how it's been for a while you know if I thought well being a sh that that's now we've done it it's a pity we've not got mind you I mean it can go potty again in a few years

Carpets down and then we got their cook er and the fridge and that and well you know and that goes through your
I know
they just go through your mind don't they
What it's all gonna look like
Will it look nice
Yeah will it go in
Will it fit and how tall is it and how wide is it
Will we be able to get in before the day to check up on what colour we want things and yo that sort of thing you know you just you know
Yeah I know
As you know cos you have the same trouble
As if we were both tossing and turning and
Yeah I know I know funny one yesterday you know but not to worry
Bound to be like that
Not to worry
Bound to be like you know a little bit
Brian knows Brian knew everything more or less or arranged quite a few things anyway
Did you
Brian knew
It's the
Oh yeah definitely
Aren't you tired now
No no jus just clearing the old eye out
When I did go to sleep I went I don't remember but it was a long while
Yeah yeah I went well eventually but like you say it was long wh it was a long while before I actually did get to sleep but got there eventually I'm been to solicitor today Annie
Got it out the way just to warn him there's no po point him getting all these letters about mortgages you know they're who you are or well can't do that can you
No got any more Annie
You got any more
No there's a packet in my bag
Oh is there
A whole packet yeah
That's alright then
My bag the weekend in case you were in trouble
That's fine then good should have enough for weekend until until the weekend
I'll have them on Friday if necessary but Thursday I get you a packet down
Oh yeah Pardon me
That should be alright Yeah we've got to go up town Thursday haven't we
Yes I know We're going to be investigating some carpet shops while you're signing on the dotted line won't need me in there now will you
Really
Really at all er apart from the m or moral support
Moral support well you need that other stuff first
side
Hold me up while I sign you know
No well I'll go with you if you want
It isn't very long Shouldn't be in there long just a matter of signing all the things checking all the details over putting in what he hasn't filled in already
And I'm hoping that they get that letter you seeing them weekend
Yes
And you're not working Saturday morning instead of going to work late we can go a bit early and do a bit of shopping ourselves
Go to town next Thursday
Before Monday
Thursday morning can't you
Don't know if I could do the electric one definitely Guess that's about whether the I'd like one of them one of them and yeah but we don't know when it can be delivered so we can't do it that early you can't say yeah but but er we'll let you know well we can so it's there that's what we wish they'd the bills go and we'll let you know when you can be the keys can be available for you to put it in
And so the Can't first
Mm I know
That's the first job first one in then you get the carpet sorted out
Yeah cos it's much easier than dragging all
At least at least you know how you know if he says you can have this one or this one yeah cos the choice between one or the other and he says well I can fit this one immediately but this one I've gotta order
They've gotta send for
I mean it might might just sway as to one way or the other if there's a bit of a well we like them both but which one you know
I don't wanna get carpets without you with me cos you have to live with them as well
I can have a look at them now in the catalogue
Yeah but they won't be exactly the same in shops
No true
Similar but not the same
No not the same that's true
Mind you I suppose out of a catalogue it's at least you can feel them and see them all that
Oh and I'd rather
Only on see the whole roll
I'd rather go in the shop and see it cos sometimes especially if it's got a pattern on turn out to be better than the catalogue cos when it comes it don't look the same and then the same colour do you
Cos a re production 's never perfect is it
No
In a photograph it's never true then you go in a shop and what you see is what you get
Definitely There's only a there's only really what two carpets and these are
carpet
two main bit
for a bathroom I mean neither were very good
Yeah but then again yeah but as I say i i if you if you want the same in the bathroom and the bedroom
Well I don't
and the same in the hall in the living room
So two colours
you only got two carpets to sort out and a bit of li no rather than having a different one with this one and a different one for that one and then a different one for
Yeah I'll go and put that together those
Alright
Alright dear
Hey Ann
What
Did you read your stars today
No
You didn't
What's it say
Saturn your ruler is in exceptionally mood now so it is likely that you will have to put up with rather spar tan conditions but you know how much is at stake for the future so you are happy to do without
That was
How about that darling
Wellthat's all that ready just popped it in the oven
Okay
Are you ready
well
It's the only thing you wanted really
Yes
Mm
No I'm sure we are Yes we certainly are dear
All seems to have happened in such a rush
Well yeah but
There's so much to think about
I know
But we had to really because
No because we wouldn't have got that fifteen hundred pounds they hadn't agreed to do us a service
No
I wanna get it through
Well they said they'd wait I mean fifteen hundred pound ain't he would pa put a deposit down it's only five percent inn it
Fifteen hundred pound if he was prepared to put a deposit down or something that would have been fifteen hundred quid
Yes
So we got it
He must have been looking for bathroom
Yeah
Otherwise he wouldn't have accepted without any
Without any quibble
No
I thought it was worth pushing for the extra I mean when he said a thousand I thought it would be
Yeah
worth pushing for an extra five hundred and did get it
Yeah well he said a thousand because he knew he could get he'd carpet that er er for a thousand
Yeah
That's why he mentioned that sort of figure if all you wanted was a or a fridge a cook er and some carpets you could do that easy on a thousand
Yeah but now we got the extra five hundred and which I say is th is makes up for the which is five percent of the purchase price we've got an extra to play with and get a bit more
Yeah
Not too bad
Gotta be careful when I'm cooking I shall have to have the window open me I've got smoke alarms all over the place darling which is good in a flat
True true
Mm but er m you get steam up in the cooking are a and er
Yeah
Ding a ling a ling a ling a ling a ling
Right yeah
You think bloody hell what the hell's going on here
There is a smoke alarm in the airing cupboard in case that overheat s and there's one
In the hall
No
I've only seen one I haven't seen any more than one at
There's supposed to be one in the airing cupboard
Seen that one
Case the airing cupboard overheat s but it says on the spec one airing cupboard when it will have hot water tank and smoke alarm
Oh
Ooh ooh ooh
In case you let it hot water tank starts playing up
M hm It says it doesn't but like I say i in a way it usually starts

Oh yeah Fire services recommend everybody to have it
Mm
especially in an upstairs flat
Mm mm
It's a and plenty of warning to get out
M hm
That's why he's had them put in cos the flat 's more than house in in the only thing is I would say to you to let a heat from the kitchen and the
Yeah
smoke and steam they do tend to keep going
Set them off
Ha ha and everybody starts running out the door and all you're doing is frying some breakfast or something
Burning the toast
I'll be dissuade d buying a pussy cat altogether now won't I
Ha ha Yeah it is
Once it starts that upstairs flat
It is a little bit er
With a deadlock on the front door so he can't get in and out or anything
Oh yeah can't jump on the window to get in or anything
Mm no they wanted to be in but you not hear it no I think pussy cat is gonna be a no no about us you'll have to
Well it's certainly gonna be certainly won't let it
Looks like a
It's gonna be a little bit tricky isn't it really having a
I think I would just about give up over that
It's a shame
but I mean a downstairs one wouldn't be quite so bad
Yeah
but those stairs won't like I mean I wouldn't like it that if it was just indoors forever would you honestly
Not really
It's not fair on an animal even
It's not natural no
Cats or something
Not really is it
No I know and I don't fancy litter trays and things either
We might do one day or see
Yeah but but not while we're there I don't think it's must get another budgie sometime get Steven's budgie or something
Yeah a cat's a little bit out on dashing upstairs now inn it really
It's a shame but there you go
Definitely is up here it's
Yeah
not fair on a animal as I say he's bound to be trapped at the bloody door for hours before anybody come in and
It ain't fair
No
Actually that's something we'll have to negotiate with our er opposite neighbour
The sta i r carpets
sta i r carpet
Hadn't thought of that well that's gonna be noisy anybody coming home late at night wooden stairs
Don't know who you got we'll have to wait and see who we get
Well fling that rug out the hall it'll be a start bung it out on the landing for a start
Yeah yeah
So at least there's something up there at the doors to wipe your feet on and what not but I'm not splashing out on sta i r carpet until somebody else has been
Oh no
in as well
Yeah
Well there's something that will have to be will be
needed eventually
I say a negotiation with next door neighbour or something like that
But you come home late at night when people are asleep
Start banging up the stairs and
and you lot and stroll in after half past four an five o'clock in the morning you know you do
Yeah
If I don't get up till nine it's a bit
Yeah
It won't be very nice so we'll have to just manage as for as the stall light the hall lighting who is responsible for that
Cos the staircase has gotta be lit I mean you can't get
There is a light out there isn't there
I noticed that
I mean who who cares for the electricity
It's gotta be on someone's electric hasn't it
You can't one flat 's not gonna be responsible for having the hall lit up all night long which it will be and then length of time unless it's on a timer switch
Mm that is something we will have to investigate
I know
di discuss with our
I mean with
Steven's flat the council are responsible for lighting hallways but we th they're not
No no that's right
They must be on some sort of a one of the meters or somebody's meter or somewhere
Yeah
That smells mm mm
Mm mm
Well that's gonna be alright I don't understand why every time
You
Give it another ten minutes make sure the top the bacon
Yeah
Nice
I've gotta nip upstairs
Er yes
Cos I wouldn't know I've done enough okay
Yep that's fine
I think we need to a empty the ashtray darling
Yeah
Or do we get a new car
I think so I said said to the bloke before
Yeah let's have it

Bless me
Oh
got a cold you better go home
On traffic lights
Yeah definitely poorly mother's sick for a fortnight
Well off we go back to work
Won't use so much petrol from now on anyway to get to work will we
Wouldn't be a lot of difference actually
Oh won't it
No By time you I mean it's not that far but by the time you get there the car won't have a chance to warm up thoroughly
Oh use more petrol I see
So you'd be on automatic choke for a bit of the way most of the way anyway so
Mm
a little bit but not a great deal those gears most of the time as well the ones that we cruise in top gear I don't think that's really for me
Oh
Not appreciably amateur
Ah sorry won't do it perhaps you turn li little bit there
A little bit perhaps I wouldn't of said it would have been
No cos they'll still be popping out to the an will we not
I hope so
Yeah so do I don't wanna lose touch with them now
That would be stroll up to the Royal Standard
Yes that's it some odd nights we was on our way home from work it's going up to the even when we're on ear lies and and weekends we can go there can't we
It's not that far there along the bypass there it's not that far away is it
About that again it's a similar distance I would say
That's what I mean it's not
It's as near to the as it would have been from there
So it's not a lot of lot of bother the only thing is that i you gotta drive in town rather than drive on country lanes to get to the main roads little bit more dangerous as far as getting caught is concerned ha
It's we can always walk up the
Yep walk in the town if you're going
Walk in the town
if you want a good drink doesn't matter does it
Can you get through to town there's no through road that way other end but couldn't is there any short cuts you get into town that way
No
No it's a longer way
Is it
Yeah
Ah I just wondered I mean I don't know out that way
No er m might as well continue now half way round do a u - t u r n
That's going the wrong way dear
Yeah looks like it dunn it
Not sure of where he is mm mm
No the only w
He's forgotten something
The only way to town is come up to way
And come back again
towards Boy's School then Corporation Road and then in town
No I didn't know if you could walk if there's any short cuts if you wanted to walk into town
No no there's not
I jus just wondered not knowing the are a as well as you do wondered if there was a little
You go down to the bottom of these roads there and
Do you end up sort of metal box end
No there's metal boxes at each
Well
end
Yeah I know that's what I mean if you get walking down there you'd come to all the factories I presume
If you come up er when you're at the Weasel Lane
Mm m hm
instead of turning up towards the Royal Standard you turn the other way that comes down past
Mm
Then you go right down to the bottom of Road you cos that's a dead end anyway
I didn't know if there was lanes going off into town whe or oh I don't know
M hm
I shall have to be looking out for a second hand bike - y just for the occasional trip into town without getting Stu e y out of bed so I be a bit more independent than just bothering you all time if I just wanna pop anywhere
It isn't a great problem not really
No I know my but it it'll give me a little independence as well will it not
You got a shop at the top of the road ain't you
Yeah it's not far is it
Shops at the top there
It's not far from Rainbow really to do you main shopping if you in a hurry is it
No that's up that's just up the
Yeah not far
The new Tes cos won't be the other way will it
The other way no
Yeah yeah that's what I mean it we're nearer to the both of them really
Always fascinates me that a little person driving a big car
Mm a bit odd
It looks very odd yes when the heads hardly go above the the seat you don't have is it a kid driving or a an adult or is anybody driving
Or is it just t run d ling off on its own
Hello er I need a solicitor to act for me er if that's possible please
It was mentioned that Mr might be able to help me
Yeah but if you'd like to come back though cos he's at lunch at the moment

I know your type
I just want a clean staircase
No we're not
Right we've made a decision I know we can but er
Not being a driver darling I don't know really much about such things never had to worry I've always found somewhere chain my bike to a lamp post or er ha
That's quite often why I like when I go down Nor bet Street I don't like parking in Nor bet Street itself cos it's only half an hour if you park down Royal Place it's
It's a
an hour
It's an hour
Then I could have an hour you see so it just gives you that extra breathing space if you
Yeah cos half an hour's
not really long you get talking to somebody and
That's it you go to
you've
the butchers or the baker s or
Yeah
you have a couple of bets in the bookies that sort of thing
Half hour can soon be gone
Quite normal to be a little bit more than half an hour but el traffic o war dens about an whoever takes your number sort of jus just after you parked then it is half an hour but sometimes it's not for
No why that's why they come round
yeah but you don't know that do you
No
If you're in the bookies and you don't happen to see them
Well they're just doing their job otherwise people would park anywhere all the time Oh dear
Take me home
I'd love to
I'm having a sudden attack attack of I don't know what but
Morbid it y
ah what's that mean
How's that sound
That sounds wonderful yeah look good on a signal
Morbid it y
What's that
Well not feeling very happy morbid
Morbid
Mm yeah
Yeah oh yeah I've definitely got attack of that
Work it us
Yeah definitely Idol it us more like it
Oh no you're not idle are you darling
No way are you idle
I don't know
I could quite easily become
Now now
Yep
Where shall we park today Ann
Wherever you think is suitable
Dunno I know where I'd like to park Not here
Not here
Anywhere but here
Well park somewhere else then
Ha w thorn Cottages

We'd like to
So Ann told us so that's
They wanted too much money
Hello hello hello hello

Oh yeah oh
So
And we might ask a depending on how much it's gonna be ask I dunno if Rogers still got his van or
Or somebody you know give them

twenty quid or something if they'll me theirs or
It's only really the bed the washing machine the table and a couple of wardrobe s

They wanted too much money for it I mean we paid three thousand in rent and that was supposed to come off i the still wanted
Oh
the same a as what Ann had for theirs I mean we've had it for a year and paid all that rent

Well we would but we'll live

Yeah
Well about another hour
Have we got some more Birds Eye pies up to t russ
Yeah
they didn't do them
Actually they perhaps let us go back on them then
Well
tomorrow
if you do that I think perhaps that's the best kind of action have a word with him and go down I mean
You mean go back on them cos we didn't finish them cos there was three pal lets and we didn't even do two
There's only twelve with a last week weren't there
We didn't finish them cos they wanted to start tru s sing early
It's what you had last week
and then Ann started that little line tru s sing you see so we've done it between us but I've got a thousand to do and she's got about four d t
Ann even if they do some
I bet you feel like a now give them in when they can't t russ them dunno
That I've only had
We give them in when they came trussed with the though we had before
It's not very heavy Really to start a t russ that's
Well with the two lines going yeah would have been about right then but see John I don't suppose he realised Ann was gonna fetch all the people out of here there and everywhere and start that up
What did he do did he say
Well I pa
Ann
No
no so she started tru s sing helping me
Yeah yeah but he wouldn't
I suppose that's what John thought we might not get them done start early and get them finished
That's good
He just said leave the Bird's Eye pies and start your tru s sing
That was gone seven o'clock when
Yeah
By time we've cleared all that especially the
All that p v cAn n

Yeah
He couldn't even do your
He wouldn't d he didn't wanna do it did he
He took it back
He said he wanted office
Ha
You know I remember him
Yes

Yeah
said well you do what you did with him and show showing him how to do
all the job she said I don't want to learn them I've come to supervise he said I don't wanna get muck y
Oh no
I couldn't believe my ears
I said Oh
So why John said would I show you how to t russ nice I don't wish to learn thank you
Is that what he said to you
Yeah he said I
Oh I didn't know that
He said he'd come to supervise not to do it
I've no no wish to learn it thank you
I said well fair enough I'll go to do something else
See John when he we as soon as John arrived he said to me will you take me he said I don't wanna learn it prof ic i ent ly but I want to know every job so I then took
And then watch
up and down every line
every line
You got to expect to be
and i and when this Peter come he said well you know just show him everything and like you did me and he said he didn't wanna know thank you
I didn't know he said that to him
Yeah he said
Yeah
he said I come to sup be supervisor he said I don't know I don't wish to learn all that
Well can you supervise if you don't know what the hell's going on
I sa said to John
That's what John said he wanted lo
I said last week
so he good a rough idea
John I hope you don't mind I said gotta call he said you
Mm
he said you should have asked Jim
Yeah
because it was between you and him
Well that's certainly my feeling I'm naturally disappointed but it I say you did well and i er
Mick said to me last night he said to me you can never fit not used to it but
No point is there
No there's certainly
That's it
I said I've failed
I said I just haven't got
That's it
You're not forgiven
No I'm listening to them I'm doing a project
Aha
I'm taping all your conversations anyway
Oh right
not in the factory I didn't li I could of asked Tom
What in here
Everywhere I go
Oh I shall be quiet
It's all anonymous you're not e e e nobody know who it is it's for it's for a dictionary and they want new words that are commonly used and they don't want and all old words that never get used it'll be dropped in the next edition of the dictionary
I go I anything
No it's er I'm taping all my conversations I have with everybody for a week
What if people don't want you to
Oh yeah you you have to erase it but nobody's gonna sa I mean to say nobody knows who you are what you've said anyway at all do they
Well I don't know if you're just gonna write down
What
what you put on there and that
I don't write anything I send the tape in they don't know who you are you're just a it's just a voice speaking nobody knows who you are or anything they only know me nobody else
then
Why
Who's who's gonna know when they lis to compile a dictionary and what words you use who's gonna know who you are
Ha dunno speaking
That's all well if you want it erased I will I mean it's up to you entirely
Well you won't have any trouble with Jean i e
but
Ay I I've I've said that to them I said well you might have if I take to work you'll certainly hear some they said tha well if that's common us age words that's what it has to be and words that we never use at all that are in di c tion ari es and nobody ever uses them they want to know common ordinary speech words that we use
Can't get more common than me
E y I told them I said you might hear some right a I was in the pub Saturday night mind I did tell afterwards and he's ever such a nice b l fella he comes over door
so he's killing himself laughing I I've got to tell you Ron I've been taping he said I don't give a monkeys you tape what he said let them all hear they'll all be able to pass it round
It ain't well it wasn't really disgusting but it
Are you ready
said he wouldn't
I said I got a good joke for you here started to laugh and he said I ain't said it yet
Well I didn't tell him it he can wind it just erase it I mean I don't I said I'm alright love just to do all that I've got twenty tapes
Someone asked me whether I thought it'd be a bit of fun But as I say nobody knows who you are or what you've said or anything so it doesn't matter does it
It's the words they're interested in not what you actually say and the
words that yo people are using I've got now so I don't even think of it it's just there and I just talk normal that's the idea really and if anybody asks you what you're doing then you tell them and it and you say if you don't wish to be on it well
wipe it off but nobody knows who you are anyway so what difference does it make
Unless it got personal I'd turn it off I mean I mean when we went the estate agents and solicitor s
Be Alan be Alan Whic ker
sort of sit there putting what the solicitor said in your
turn them off
Or if anybody told me I mean I wouldn't and talking in confidence about their private life or
No
just turn them off and that's it Just normal conversations the words that people use in common different areas of the country with accents and th dialect and one thing and another it's for the Oxford English Dictionary the next edition
It is very old
We've got to take that specification thing with us this morning it will might help
What time
Seven foot six by seven kitchen plus units so you would get two metres it's not very much at all
At least you'll know exactly rather than sort of saying well
I know it was fourteen by nine foot something I'm up to nine ten which is exactly which she said
They'd rather do that than having to piece twelve quarter then you've got to have join the bit then all the pattern that will be matching exactly er you'll use more
to cover er a me tre
you have to cos they can't do nothing with the bits they give you all the bits
Well yeah you do you can't end up quite a lot of it
Mm
suppose they have to match the pattern otherwise it does look quite silly which is what they've done in here they haven't matched the patterns that wall there is it it ain't joined
Isn't joined
walk in here this is the end of the where they all went too and that piece is a piece cut off and it's not it's gripped together underneath
Yes yes
but it just knocked the cotton sticks out just put the piece downthere's no way I'm gonna do this so it doesn't matter does it
No
That's definitely this is the raw bit and that's a bit of the end of the cut - o f f p r o b a b l y have the landing or something can use the rest of it through
Oh I say this is nine foot nine just gonna get a bit for it tie a little bit on edge and that's it
Bedroom has got a it's in an al cove so you'll have that piece where it's bottom of the stairs or wherever I mean the stand on slip mat s you're gonna get that because of the the airing cupboard is part of the hall part of the bedroom and nothing you can do about that one and on the wall it's just gonna be one length of each room cut off perfect actually they don't normally do that they usually just the measure ment cos I not never understood why they don't have measurements there all standard you guarantee use the one strip of another roll
The new houses are pretty standard why don't they convert them you know you guarantee if you use six rolls of wa wallpaper you'll need one to seven something silly like that
Way it always goes an extra roll need to buy
Need to buy you have done
That's a lo
To do underneath the window or on top of the door or some silly thing like that
a lot a lot of places where you can buy eight rolls and only use seven
eight back and er
Certainly when we get settled in after Christmas that should be and I'll shall say about six rolls but I'll shall say six rolls and just the every time I get one roll of wallpaper up and you you'll think oh I'll do the rest tomorrow just a bit more then you get one more looks alright there the other wall and er I'm sat I've been up all night doing this shall do one more then I'll go a bed I get from the wife bloody hell mother what time did you go to bed about an hour ago couldn't leave it wallpaper

What they putting in there next
got a bit there
There's a p u d d y t at hello p u d d y t at
certainly don't think where we going is suitable for a p u d d y t at hours and hours on end and not being allowed to go outside and even when we're there I say we can't be running up and down them bloody staircase s letting cats out I couldn't I couldn't bear the thought of it never going out
It's unnatural really is it
Yeah they like to roam about and explore and and and er I'm not sure I wanna cope with litter trays for ever would you
No
Would rather a cat be out cos it wants to be out
Yeah
Does as it wants to do when it goes outside rather than inside
I mean when it's warm though litter stuck in the er me rm it maybe greeting you and
Even a modern cat litter nowadays
Oh yeah
unpleasant
oh yeah
remember our sit would not be flat smells of cat but not only that if it weed on me carpet as much as I love it I might get a
er I think it would be get your cat out of here
Your cat of my
Exactly my cat it mine when it was good and yours when it was being horrible
Not on not only do they wee on the carpet but they also have a tendency to try and avoid cover it up
Cover it up yes pull all the threads
Pull all the
pull all the bits
I'm very I like if they haven't got a scratching board scratch what's in the
Yeah
no I don't think we'll have a pussy cat for the foreseeable future not shut up I say it's different if they can go out sharpen their claws on a bit of bark or unless I end up with a goldfish
A goldfish get hungry make a few chips
yes darling
What's for lunch dear well ready
fish
Yeah oh I'd have to call it James
dream occasionally inn it strange help is one goldfish is male or female how's one know whether to call it James or Jessica or I haven't the faintest idea how you sex a fish
Neither have I
Oh one of the mysteries of lifehow do you sex a goldfish
Pretty trees
Yeahthat's why a that's all it is you see there's no mention of any advice you or whatever she said she just don't see any point of anybody else buying cheaper somebody hit the the thing in the middle of the island there smashed all the glass one of these things there's all got smashed
Summer again
Are they
Yeah
Oh mm
Bulbs to
Yeah no such a I mean you
what was the point of that now we've got one
That's it
You can buy a car for
Yes that's it that's a new one or a relatively new one
Got
Yep
Perhaps
I mean they might not be from this so
True very true we have er m
I don't know no

That's it that's
Oh well
Never mind have a look and I might have a there we are how's that alright dear you have a look
yeah coming to the empty that was
Yes
David
Yes same type of thing as mmmm
Don't like that
I don't think he could that's three hundred and ninety nine oh

Nice isn't it very good it's quite nice isn't it
I'm more than happy with something like that
Do we second hand suite second hand suite the whole lot
It's that
We go for a second hand suite as well or
a microwave
Go for a microwave or do you just go for
We've got nine hundred pounds approximately after the cook er and the fridge
Five hundred pound for carpets leaves four hundred pound two hundred pound for suite and the microwave
say there's so many combinations that's the thing isn't it
Yep
There are so many combinations of what to have what to get what we can't get what we need really I think is what we need is obviously going to be priority isn't it
Yes
Carpets cook er fridge
Yeah
they're the definite needs and er m
That was eleven hundred pounds
approximately you've got four hundred pound really to play with approximately four hundred pound left over say five hundred pound six hundred for electrical goods
Pardon
Seven hundred did you say oh no two seventy nine and three twenty something weren't it
Yep
Er threetwo
About six hundred
Six hundred yeah
Six hundred for them two and five hundred for carpets
Eleven you've got four hundred pound you got so it's a good second hand one or a cheap y no well it would be a cheap y I told him most of them around about seven hundred and ninety nine
Decent
A reasonable one I mean you can go up to two thousand for a good one but a reasonable one you wouldn't get nowadays under seven hundred and ninety nine
I think you'd be better off with a with a new cook er and fridge
Oh yeah definitely I think
you can go second hand
rather than go second
but er you know er at least if you go in there at least you've got
got
got a guarantee for six months
yeah yeahbut
but at least you know you're going to get a decent amount of
Two or three years on the others
As with a new one you'll probably gonna get four fivesix s eve neigh
I don't like just I couldn't be like Deirdre and put me overall on and in go in without collecting me thoughts getting myself together Deirdre never arrives till about three minutes before she gets in the door she's putting her overall on saying come on ladies its time were but she's putting her overall and on and they all sit there looking at her and so
they all sit there looking at her and saying bloody hell she ain't got her own hat on we've been here quarter of an hour and she walks in the door takes her coat off and says come on ladies you're suppose to be off your hind by two o'clock leaving here at two
She's right
I know she's right but she should set an example in some ways mm people are so used to her now they just look at her and carry on talking silly old bugger you know shut up Deirdre I'm don't want to do that shouldn't be cos there wasn't much to put on although they left left quite a bit off yesterday they cut short there was five hundred breast portion short and two hundred oyster eggs so Deirdre informed me but they injected six hundred too many and four hundred eggs to Tes cos all quite ridiculous
Pardon
Put them off today's
I know but it's just waste of time in it they'd been better spent to finish the order that they did have and inject that ha oh be fair to do that to use though no doubt they will pick out all the things we didn't do right bloody should done too many of this or not enough of that
Ah yeah
difference wasn't worth putting that down

Get those soon as pos sand I'll go and look in the carpet shop
Yes
find out a few details and I'll meet you back at the estate agents
Oh
or if you're out early well forms sign so you might be a little while and if you've got oh we're going to mum's then aren't we
Said it's still very early we could pop to Lever ing ham oh we don't know where it is we might have some details in this what we gotta do with my money
My house my house my
I shouldn't think until you at least gone to the mortgage he's gonna give us authorization to spend his money
I'm not gonna use author i to go and spend one thousandfive hundred pounds and it all falls through
That's true that's true that's true
after we've spent it
very true very true
And what we having for lunch
Don't know I don't know what we're having
Taking fish to mum's or find something when we get there
You taking depends how old it will be don't it don't know how old it will be
No
No point in buying fish extra if we know we're gonna be have to wait or something
If we're gonna be late we'll have to buy the fish cos we won't have time to cook anything
Oh fish and chips you mean from the chippie
Yeah yes I'll just have a piece of fish and you can have fish and chips we won't have time to cook anything will we
That's what I mean
Depending on the time
or I say chicken alright
Depending on how long we're gonna have to cook it well I mean oh well what I can still you'll have to fish and chips
still you perhaps have to buy fish and chips
Why
cos Ann hasn't got a lot of pennies anyway
Nor has Stu e y
hasn't he
Oh bloody hell we're poor streaks then dear
That's wise you know
Bloody hell then it's chicken
Right oh
yeah well we've got some er m cordon b le u or some whatever you know
It can go in microwave
or whatever's
Go in the microwave that's all I ain't got much money at all I didn't have that much left I bought mum's c i g s and that bit of shopping the other day and that was the end of that we will survive
Pay day late again
Even if we only have a tin of soup that will do me
Yeah I don't mind so it's pay day today
Yeah but you can't get it till tomorrow there is a little bit in the bank but not a lot go wait till tomorrow and we must get to Chester Hill today
I like that I don't like Jason Donovan but I quite like that do you
Not bad
I don't like him I never have but I try notquite pleasant isn't it
Oh yes pleasant oh yes pleasant
I've never liked anything else he's had particularly have you
But I just find that pleasant listening
Oh it's a pleasant sound
Pleasant and nice songs I suppose I don't know it's just quite like it it's now big it's about the most thing he's ever recorded that I have liked
Mm
I've absolutely never been a Jason Donovan fan before Christmas number one's going to be Bohemian R hap sody which I do like you know
I know will do
yesit's already going to the top of the charts to be number one for Christmas all the other Christmas songs are
They're all coming down and that one's er
yep
going up
that will do
They always prices keep falling
Well I understand its reasoning but I think if you've been very hard pushed list with this money don't you
Mmmm
Considering I'm not supposed to have that cos I had it when Ann and bought it not sure if it's now are you
Not really was though I thought we were offering a reasonable price taking everything into consideration
upstairs and
price market
market
er m how long we've been here sitting tenants er
I'm not thinking it object the sitting tenants
the I thought that was fair
as it stands at the moment
fairly good deal
Mm
See here they're gonna get thirty six for it as it stands put it on the market as
Might do yeah
Might even two years
When you look at look at the old houses on the mark e term yeah I think he might just he might wait a while there aren't that many buyers
Oh that's it that's why they're coming down that's why are quite pleased to see us dear especially at this time of the year not many people will buy Christmas time think oh we'll wait and go and get Christmas over and the spring and
I think looking at the market you can you can get a er m detached semi - d e t a c h e d sort of one you know one bedroom I suppose
You can get two bedroom
two bedroom at a push for about thirty fourthirty five thirty sixthirty seven
oh I don't know I don't know I think it will be a while getting rid of it yesbut I think he might get his price eventually but it will take a long while to get it it's up to him if he wants a quick sale you know thirty five yeah I thirty five thousand I think as I say taking everything into consideration I mean failing three okay I know I did the thirty three so take thirty five thirty three and a half oh he ain't got much to worry about
Well
I'd better get some cloth i es on cause a bit of a stir round the estate agents naked from the waist down darling
What that's ten minutes slow Just a - f - b o u t done all your paper work on them teams
I know
got a he's coming tomorrow you know got the bird as well ain't we that's why I got up early to I go through deeply objective
Why what's been
it's completely anonymous number you know it's only to be on that said I'll wipe it off then you bloody well won't I think he wants to tell people before he can say very wrong could say something personal if it was personal no longer it no you weren't personal to you but I'm quite happy to arrange it if you wish nonono no no I shouldn't have to tell you not to take my points in full there we go it's driving me doing that in the factory having without people's permission I want to know I ask permission if I'd er wanted to as a without being asked to do it I would of gone and seen personnel and asked I would not of dreamed of doing it in a work's situation unless I was asked say anything personal I'd turned it off not that it apart from me and Stuart
Go on
apart from me and Stuart there's nothing personal on it really we went me and er telling me about her problems I only put that on a tape do you
its not er
you know anything personal like that you turn it off don't you not that they know or care wh i anyone's personal problems anyway they don't know who we are
Cos a conversation like that very well be a private person will not be a
but then again you you might you might come up and say say something that that they wanna hear you wanna hear
Yeahbut
No but you said you
yeah
that's what I mean
the person have a private conversation and let someone say it to me and it what they problems it's not something that you wanna be on somebody else's to listen to is it
You just don't do it you know its anonymous
Deirdre 's the only person that's er m got one I on there
Saw her car

Wash the curtains today in the pub Oh god I got a frog in me throat
Where you going to park
No
I can't understand why people who do who work in town don't use that one really
Pardon
I doubt they do as well
Oh I don't know cos there's a hell of a lot of people parking same cars in that multi - s t o r e y in there
Let's have a look then
can if you want in the it's not that far to go around and use one for the whole day
Pardon
I suppose
Yeah that gets pretty full weekends but I don't like that one every week in The Standard there's always a you know this break in that break in and
When you park your car you've got the breaking in
I know but that one seems worse than anywhere isn't it every week you know stolen out of the car park car broken into I mean who's I can't imagine with all them cars in there that nobody ever seems to see anything
No
Or they do and turn a blind eye
Quite often that happens late at night doesn't it you know
Yeah
after chuck ing out time
I think a lot of people are just you know I'm not getting involved in them they might belt me one walk away anyway you can't blame them sad people can't people can't say it were you and your boy you know leave that leave that alone or else I'll go and get a policeman the fear of them
Young
belting them one
go and get a policeman time you've gone and got a policeman they're off
They're gone
you know so there's no
seen so much of it that it that somebody will see some of it but thenwell maybe there and he didn't really er m you know you get out of it quick
Turn a blind eye don't they
Yeah cos they don't want to get involved and they're frightened of the consequences
more police statements and probably hours police stations
Yeah
that to find out that you shopped them they just as liable to put a brick through your window or belt you one or damage your car next time they see it
Yeah
So you can't blame people in that respect really
So it's if you want to get it done this will be one hell of a big car park won't it
Yep
If only
That's er quite full dear
No
I can't make out what they're doing today it's all parked all fully today

Shall I do you put a lot of stick on the saying it's not so do you know the in a position to exchange contracts
No
No
So I mean
We're in a position to exchange contracts at any time but the solicitor it's up to the solicitor
Yes okay so as soon as he he comes for confirmation then we'll exchange
I'll put I'll put that one anyway cos it sounds like okay
Right
Thanks very much for your help okay bye
That's okay she's also given me the right words to use to put it through urgently okay cos I mean you I know you haven't exchanged yetbut you want to do that fairly quickly
What is that that'll be with the solicitor when he's when he's gone through everything I
Okay well that that that can go on risk on a phone call
Mmmm
okay so if I mean if you come to me and see and say we wanna exchange on tomorrow
Yeah yeah
and ere rm that's that's already got you know so if I put that in today
Mmmm
Mmmm

Mmmm
as soon as possible if you give them to me some time next week say Wednesday Thursday Friday and we can say right I want it Friday or Monday okay I've just got to phone them and they will they will put it on risk for you
Mmmm
it usually it only takes a day once they've received it if that's alright
Yeah
Fine
We'll try and get it legal before
But we done what actually what actually happens now I mean what I mean my mortgage what
We just
what is that what happens to that thirty thousand pounds that I've now applied for
Does that go to the solicitor s or
to my solicitor s or where does that go to now
What what do I just have to sit and wait until it all gets accepted and they sit on it or
No it's a it's a it's a hundred percent mortgage isn't it
Yeah
Okay so we tie that up with the solicitor so so it's
On a yeah
so the solicitor has to be er he acts for you he doesn't act for anybody else
Oh I see
and he protects you and he says that's okay to go ahead so once we've er established when you want to exchange contracts and everything
Yeah
it's just a matter of him sort of saying that's perfectly okay I mean you can get a copy of that or phone call from them well if he's if he's not happy with anything they they're quite willing to contact him direct
Mmmm
okaynow er as long as the standing order 's kicking okay there's not a problem you have not got to worry now er mall it is is it just falls into like
the payments come out twenty five years one pays out the other end of story
Mm
The one whenwhenwhen when does the mortgage payment actually come out
The actual two hundred and whatever it was
Er
Seventh of January if we've got it
On c once you know the date of exchange of contracts
Yeah
okay it's the nearest to the fifth the fifteenth or the thirtieth
Oh I see
so if you do it say if if it was exchange contracts today
yeah
you could the the next payment is due on the fifteenth
Oh I see
But if you exchange contracts on the f if the fifteenth
so we start paying for the mortgage when the contracts are exchanged
Absolutely
Oh I see
yes
yeah
till then it's everything's in the air okay
Ok right - y - o h
But if you've got any more questions I mean don't hesitate to come back because at the end of the day I'd rather you know too much than not enough
not enough that's it
well I mean if you've been in you sat the opposite way
Yeah yeah
you know what it's I mean it only costs me five minutes on the phone and I've got the information for you but if you've got a sleepless night that's not worth it
No
One small
Still that doesn't matter if because if I put
yes because
in case it makes a difference to your
hang on I have got the figures here
Er m twelve ninety twelve ninety four er m I I don't think
you're absolutely spot on cos you had them on the other one didn't you
So I've altered that to twelve ninety four and there's a twenty eight
So have I
that is an eight O one okay
What number
and in fact you
smoke r it's on your medical thing
When when we got access to the medical thing
it said non smoke r
It said cigarettes do I smoke cigarettes and I said no
which is honest
which which is
yes yeah
so make it out cheaper
they'll make them out cheaper
a little bit cheaper
absolutely yeah
Fair enough as long as though we honest
Well I think you know you you you it was an honest answer to to both questions cos they didn't say do you smoke a pipe that you smoke you know or whatever or just said cigarettes
Don't smoke cigarettes and I thought no when it comes back it may work out much cheaper
Yeahthat's right
Right okay thanks very much
Okay see you again
Bye now
Bye
Yeah
Not good is it
No
I mean this is a bitch
I'm not the best to s pick it up on the stitches and
No I'm not either
I'm not either
Well how's things
hard
Oh fine
Are you now a house owner
Well subject to him getting the mortgage
He's signed er for everything and seen the solicitor

Fish and chips
Fishy chip p y
Do you wanna set up table or do you want or
Not unless you want to sit at the table do you
It's up to you

So that's it then is it
Yeah we've just got now wait for solicitor s an an and the mortgage
Have you got in touch with a solicitor
Yeah he's been to see him
Oh he's been to see him already
Yeah
Ooh
So that's all arranged and now it's just waiting for everything to
Yeah and how do you think how long do you think they're gonna take
How long do you
Well the mortgage people have said a couple of days
Ooh well
then we'll know whether he's got it or not
I mean all the papers won't be through but they can tell us whether it's
Yeah
alright
And then you can exchange contracts solicitor
But he said he's got a lot of things to go through before he
Yes a a week
he can advise us so
You might have it in a week
Mm maybe next week you'll be
We can exchange contracts probably next week some time
Well when you exchange con t ra that's it
Because you don't have to wait for anybody getting out
You know it's not like
No that's it
like
You need to
Eh
partake
Fine thank you
You want a cup of tea
Yeah I'm gonna put the kettle on
Yeah alright
Yeah make us a cup of coffee Stuart

That's a beau Help y do what you like
So it's all up to the solicitor s really er their solicitor s and and Stu art's solicitor s they will get everything s sorted out
Yeah
The legal details
Yeah
Yeah that's it then
Mm
Getting exciting now
And once we've exchanged contracts then we can have this solicitor 's letter for this fifteen hundred pound to go ahead and all this that and the other
That's right
So we can start deciding what we're having and where
It's funny you know we went to
Well you sh when you j er er j er you you think your contract you should get the key Ann
Just about
You will it won't be take long
No
after that if you
No
I mean the contract's the
They're trying their best to get it done before christmas so
Ooh
shouldn't be that long
Did you tell them that you've got a you're now living you know
What are you gonna do
Yeah
about that
That's what you've got to make up your mind about
When you moving out
Well he's got to ring Mr and see if he if he really pushes for a month's notice well we'll have to just pay another month and stay you know
Yeah
And if if he doesn't if he says that's fair enough well we're er m there's no point in paying another one when that money can go towards something else can't it
He's had to pay forty pound this morning
Still have to have a search
Isn't it
ridiculous
Even though it's a brand new house and they're not gonna pull it down tomorrow to build a bloody factory on top of it
Yeah I know Ann but see it could be a er a jerry - b u i l t
He's had to pay he's got to pay forty pound this morning for a search
Yeah
Solicitor s
Yeah
You see it could be jerry - b u i l t
What are you doing
We'll sit here
It's alright
Sit here
It's no problem

Do you want
You can get her get her get her
I just want a piece of fish
Salt

Sure
Yeah
You could get er it could be a jerry - b u i l t
No he has to pay it's forty pound for this search
He said there won't
Yeah I know
be no problems as far as he knows
He's already dealt with the company so
Yeah
That's what I'm saying but aye oh well they Ann they have you
They have to do it
by the short and curl i es
They have to do it
Yeah
You you
To make sure it's not gonna have a motor way going through in next year or whatever and
I know but as I said they have you by the short and curl i es
Yeah
You just have to
You have to just sit yeah
Yes say yes and and get your cheque book out
pay up
It's true isn't it
He paid that forty pound anyway that's
Yeah yeah
made a start
Yeah
Yeah you you you er oh they are er you have to
But at least there's no stamp duty because it's less than thirty three thousand
Yeah yeah you're
And that's quite a bit of saving cos
Thirty three thousand
Is that
It's thirty three thousand under
You have to pay stamp duty for
Anything over that
Oh I thought it was more than that
I thought it
No
er m I thought the limit
Thirty three now
Ooh god
No I thought the the limit was higher than that
I thought it was about fifty thousand
Oh no it's it's
I know a lot of people used to
thirty
used to
thirty two thousand five hundred
Yeah
Anything under that you don't pay
A lot of people d used to ask the pri make the price of the house just under the stamp duty
Yeah so they could so they could didn't have to pay it
So they didn't have to pay it
I mean what is stamp duty
It's ridiculous really isn't it
Oh god that's government
That's it
Why should they have a cut of it
That's the government
Oh well you
You buy a house and have to pay the government for the pleasure
You have Ann
You have to pay for everything
You used to have to pay for the stamps you know there used to be a stamp
Had a stamp on it yeah
Do you remember the little stamp
Yeah
You used to buy the I don't know whether they do that or not now
I don't know whether they do that
I know it's quite the stamp duty can come to a lot of money can't it
Yeah
And mine did
Yeah
I read that
Yeah you had it out the other day
It's a lot of money
I didn't think it would be that
Well the solicitor just took that off the price of the house
Well that's it they just they just see to it all
You don't know how many how much
Yeah but see they can't do that with you cos you're not selling a house
No
You're just buying a house
Mm
You know so ooh they're crafty aren't they
Never mind not to worry
Not to worry all these things come to try you
Yeah
We signed all the forms anyway so that's something
But with his being tied up with a pension he gets twelve thousand pension as well
Oh that's alright
But then if he if he ever needs
Once he retires
Yeah but what happens if he snuff s it
Is that house paid for Ann
Oh yeah
Oh that's alright
That's covered
It will be yours
Yeah that's alright
Mine
Ooh
Yeah
You're his next of kin and you're the one on the paper
He had to put your name down on it
Did he
As you're next er his next of kin and you will the property will become yours
You'll have to
Is that alright
You'll have to make a will now then
If you don't want all the chips don't bother
Oh I don't want as that I didn't want as that
I said a couple
Well that is a couple
I say he'll have to make a will now
So that you'll be the beneficiary
Don't matter does it
No but you should do
Aye it does matter
Does matter
I say I can't see you saying right he's died tom today out tomorrow can you
I didn't think I'd get anything anyway
You're his next of kin you see
Am I
Mm
How about his father
Yeah how about his father
he didn't mention it
Your name's on it now
Yeah but his father's his next of kin just as much as I am Ann
put that out I'll put that out cos you'll not get any peace
You won't get any peace Ann
I'll put that out
Well your name's on it so that's it
Yeah but I was just saying when you think about it
See there's all these complications
If anything happens to me
Yeah but if you're the named person
Yeah
I don't know whether his father is probably is isn't he
M hm
See if you think about that don't you
It's the same with anything to me if I leave this house to Sheila and Bruce if anything happened to Sheila Bruce would get it
You know
Sh Sheila's dad
Shouldn't he should really but I don't really want that to happen
And that's the law isn't it
Shouldn't say that should I
I know
When my mother met we were met you know when we got married the solicitor had us in because he wanted us to make a will because see we didn't take the money that we got from mum
But if anything had happened to me any of her husbands could
Is that alright dear
Lovely thank you
Yeah
And me mum used to live off the interest on what you know dad cos he didn't leave a will
But when we got married see that complicated things because if anything had happened to me
Your husband would have been entitled to it

That's it
Well there you are

No we could do with one to keep everything together cos contracts and that you have
Do you want one
keep safe and solicitor 's letters and that
Do you want one
There might be one in the desk or out in the in the there used to be
Let us see now if there's something you could keep them in
You don't want a ring - p u l l r i n g one you know
You where are you then
Are you there you being good boys
So it's now sold subject to contract
That's what it'll have on it
Nobody else can have a look at it now
No that's what they put on them now
Nobody else can have a look
Can't they
I thought there was still time to have a look at it just in case it falls through
I don't think that they can't put a better offer in can they
When it's sold subject to contract
Well I dunno but I mean
They can't ga z ump you at the last minute cos it makes
But I mean if that goes if that goes through if that falls through somebody might be interested and and somebody might er m I dunno
Like you say probably they put subject to contract on and
Here you are I got it Ann
Have that
I've I've gotta find
that's usually what they write on them isn't it
Sold subject to contract don't they
Here you are It er m you can have that
I'll I'll probably find
Yeah
Well that will keep everything together
you a better one but Sunday
No that's fine
Mm cos you've got to keep all the bits and pieces together
Yes you do
You do
It just says thank you for your you have applied to par apply for this house subject to contract and that's it
You're subject to contract now then
Yeah
Like I say that's what they will put on the thing isn't it
Sold subject to contract
Contract yeah
It's a matter of what what are you waiting for now
To see if you've got the mortgage
No
You've got it
You've got the mortgage
As far as I know
You have
You don't need a
Well he said a telephone call will just will tell him that won't he
Oh
If you come in Monday the tel
You don't you don't
a telephone call will tell you whether you've the papers won't be drawn up but they will be able to tell him on through the phone whether it's okay
You don't need to have a medical
No
Doubt it
I think he had to give his doctors how long and what illnesses
Yeah but I just wondered he might need a medical
Dunno
Doubt it
You doubt it
Don't see any reason why I should not that they've had nothing wrong
He's had no illnesses or
I've had nothing wrong with me
I don't suffer from anything
I know I know but that's not the point
You know they you the you might have to get in touch with
Well we give his name didn't we
I mean really anybody can say anything if you don't if they don't look into it
No that's
I could say I've never had an illness in me life and whatever can't I
Anybody could s
That's right
Yes I think they'd have to do they will do
Cos otherwise you could say anything couldn't you
Yeah course you can
Course you can
You know I mean anybody could say anything
I could say no I've never had an illness
I mean it wouldn't be the truth but you if they didn't look into it you could say it couldn't you
That's right
And no doubt some people who would try that kind of thing isn't there
Oh yeah
Yeah
If they think it spoils their chances
Although does your does your health
Yeah because this is a pension mortgage you see
Yes
Yeah
You might have to have a medical
But you don't think
For the pension purpose for the pension plan a medical is not needed
That is doesn't matter
Oh well
Oh
The only thing that I might need a medical for is my thirty thousand pound life insurance
Oh
Wellthat's what I mean
I mean it's the same kind of thing isn't it
That's the I won't need if if I just did the pension
You can bump him off now you know from the fifth of January cos you get thirty thousand quid if you bump him off
Do we
You do
Oh well I won't if y
You're his beneficiary
If you put the glass yeah I'll
So once he's paid the first payment by the fifth of January
If you if you do the bumping off Ann if you do the bumping off
Ha we'll share it
Yeah
We'll go fifty fifty how about that
Yeah
Alright
You're you're you're the beneficiary of his er hi hi his f thirty thousand pound
Yeah alright
Fair enough
You do the bumping off and I'll
We'll go shares we'll have a
I'll have to see if I can get some banana skins put on the stairs
Bahamas
How about the Baha what do you fancy the best
You you wouldn't mother
No mother
Bahamas or or Australia we could go to Australia
Yeah we could go via Bahamas couldn't we
Mother
Yeah
They go that way around
Mother
Yeah we'll go
Cruise
Mother
What
Can I just
can I just intervene here and
Via New York
You know
Can I just
we could stop off at er at er m
Yeah
at Hawaii
can I just intervene here just a little bit because
Shut up we're booking our holiday
Shut up
if
if if I'm bumped off that thirty thousand pounds go off to goes to pay the mortgage
Yeah well then we could sell the flat
Oh well we'll flog the f flat then
So we'd still have the money
Wouldn't we
Well you'd have to sell the flat then
Oh well
Yeah but I mean we'd have a a flat without any any mortgage
It would be completely owned by your mum
So therefore she could do what she wanted with it
Yeah but I you you put me down as as as er next of kin you see
You can name he said who do you wish to name
Yeah
And he put your name down
I mean it doesn't say
But it has to be your parents
No it can be anybody I suppose couldn't it
Yeah I suppose it could
I don't know what
He put your he he just put your you down and that was it
Oh thank you very much
Oh well definitely
So that's it
Mm
Bahamas yes
Hawaii yes
Yeah we'll go that way round
Mm
To Australia
Visit to Australia cos we might as well have a long cruise
What yeah yeah
Mm
Better watch your step next time you drink whisky
That's what
few things on the stairs
that's what er that's what you used to say er er er er you should never ever be worth more dead than alive
It's dangerous
He used to tell me that
Didn't you
Yeah
he used to always say that
You n don't ever get yourself er m what do you call it
Worth more I'm worth more dead than alive
We all are aren't we
Most people are if they've got property aren't they
Eh
Yeah
Yeah I'm worth more dead than alive
Never mind
Well I hope I hope you're gonna be very happy
And I hope you've done the right
Yeah we are
Here you are
That's all I I'm hoping
I hope you
that Stu art's done the right thing
It's him that's signed it
Well why
Why shouldn't he
Well
He's done it with you you're he's got he's got you with him
Yeah
Hasn't he
It's not just him Ann
Well at least he knows with this m mortgage and that he knows what it's all about
It's not like one of us going in and not
Yeah
understanding and just signing papers
Yeah
At least he knows and he
What you're doing
questions and he he understands it all
Yeah
Which a lot of people would say they go and sit down there and they say blah blah blah sign here and
It's not fair but that is what happens
It's what happens because you don't understand all the
No
terms and the things they use
You don't know what they're on about
No you don't
I mean even today he'd made a mistake on that thing and you spotted it where I wouldn't have done
Oh my god
He must be
He didn't take tax relief off
Cos Stuart will get tax relief and he hadn't put that down
But Stuart noticed it straight away
I is he much cop this bloke
I think I mean it's something a pension mortgage is something that doesn't crop up every day
No not many peo you've got I don't know why
They don't know how to cope with it
I don't know why it doesn't crop up because it's cheaper than an ordinary one so why it doesn't
Because they don't want yeah well you you'd better tell your mates at work that
Why it doesn't I don't know
I don't understand that
And not only does
Is it cheaper than an ordinary one
Well it is as mu it's it's worked out a few pounds cheaper
It can it can be yeah
It can
But not only that at the end he's also as well as the house he's getting a pension as well instead of just the house
Well that's what I mean
That's what I mean
You get a pe just an ordinary pension thing you know mortgage
You don't get a pension at the end of it
You're gonna get a pension as well
Well that's it
Well that's not bad
Well er I'd never heard of it
I'd never heard of it
Not only that you see alright the mortgage rates might go up but I mean if you're working your wages are gonna go up Stuart
Aren't they
You'll have a pay rise and and you're gonna still be paying s you know
So as the years go past
Pay an average amount of your wage whatever
As the years go past I mean if the wages go up as they have done you know regularly your mortgage is gonna gonna gonna be smaller
Yeah that's that's what happens with people now
Yeah
People who are paying seventy eighty pound a month mortgage who've had them for years and then
Years
That's right
And the same thing will happen to you see
And then you'll be pleased
Yeah
You've started
I mean I know it's hard to start with
Isn't it
It is difficult
But we've got all that side sorted out haven't we
It's difficult
I mean we paid eight qui eight pound a month
Er er
and that was a hell of a lot of money
Yeah well that's it if your wages are only eight quid a week if you're paying a month's wa
That's right
one week of your wages out it's
We were
I remember that
Hal i fax Building Society
Used to I used to have to pay it
has to come out of his bank
Every month
It'll just be took automatically
Yeah well they didn't have them in these days Ann
out of your bank won't it
Direct debit
His money his money will be gone and we'll live on ours mine
So I mean it's just the same whatever isn't it
That's it
You can survive
Oh yeah we'll be alright
As I say if they took my wages into consideration they would have let us buy next door even
Yes
They would
I mean it would have been a hell of a lot of
I think nice as this next door here
Well it would have been a hell of a lot of money
How about that one across the way
Well that's it you see
But if if I'd have if we'd have gone joint we'd have had enough
Wouldn't you if if if if you had Ann if you had the choice of these two what would you rather have
Seat - y belt on Stuart
better put her seat - y belt on then hadn't she
In case mister police - y man decides to stop us and say why haven't you put your seat - y belt on Mrs M Mrs woman
Sorry sir
It's your responsibility to ensure that your passengers have got their safety belt on
Cos that would be nice wouldn't it
To be fined twelve quid for not having a safety belt on and on top of the ninety quid and the forty quid and one thing and another
but show you Pat 's house if you like
Would you like to see Pat 's house
Okay
Show you Pat's house
If you look to your left coming into the the junction say I presume I don't know whether they may even have moved now
See that one oh you see the one where the trees are
Yeah
And the front wall that sort of set back one
Yeah
That's Pat you can see it just there look
Yeah

But when I walked in
Or your dad or your
when I walked in I I said you know I said Mr we meet we meet again I said
He said ah Stuart isn't it
Ohwell
I said yes
Thought oh that that's fair enough isn't it
Yes
Where shall we park today
We'll back up to the fence today shall we
If you wish

How's that
Right yeah
Is that near enough
Yep
Yep
Yep that's
Is there one for Ann or not

Paul's cast off s
Yes yeah
That is for
That's my bum warmer
Put this on
look naked
Why not
Cause a stir if nothing else wouldn't it
Cause a stir
Stood there naked dish ing the overalls out
Everybody would be going home feeling sick
Bloody feel sick
Alright dear
I've now got there's now in the bank after I've paid me poll tax and paid me
yeah
paid me poll tax paid me s search fee and got a little bit of cash out for read i es and s there's now at this moment in time there's four hundred and fifty pound in there
And there will be another hundred and twenty go in today so that's six hundred and six hundred and seventy in there at the moment
So there's a few hundred in the building society
What do you mean crossed fingers
That's what there is and
It's not gonna come up to any more than anything
That's what I was sa that's what's in there at the moment
I thought
I'm making you de stitute aren't I
Like me
I've got three hundred and
We'll we'll be starving in our ga r re t together darling
And a few hundred in the building society
And I've still got my unit trust thing but I know it's gone down
I don't want to touch it if I'll leave and leave it if I can
It no I mean that was always my plan if ever you need the money
Okay alright
Hall o Mr
Hall o Stuart
How are you
I was alright till I see you
Cheeky bugger
I was gonna be nice to you today and all
Yeah as I say that unit trust thing I was I know it's not the safest investment but it never was the safest investment
It was a at the time it was a I'd got the money and it was a bit of a speculation
But unfortunately it's not quite worked out to plan
But I mean if
If it if if
I mean even with the market being depressed there's still gonna be eight hundred pounds in there
So it's
that's mak but that's mak making a loss
I mean I'd rather leave it if I can until it does
Yeah if we absolutely
If we're absolutely desperate then
We'll have to do it
Is it hard getting them out
I don't know or I can't remember
Few few days
Phone them up phone them up
Find out what
You don't want to make a loss if you don't have to
find out what the price is and if the price is you know whatever then you take them out
Just say right I'll cash take cash and you and they will send you a cheque in the post more or less
But as I say yeah
un fort un unfortunately I mean if I'd left it where it was er m would have it would have been better
So say if we have to we have to
You know I'd rather wait until you know till
Until it's taken out
till then
That's right
Until the market picks up again and
I mean it's not a good investment is it
Speculative
yeah yeah but the when I was
It's alright
when I was advising
Well well well that's it
when I was advising people on unit trust things it was always the price of your units may rise and as well as fall
Er
I mean there's safer investments
That's what I meant
Oh yeah I mean it was
If you wanted to
at the time I mean it it was
It didn't matter so much to you
Didn't matter so much at that particular time
And the market looked as though it was gonna be quite buoy ant
I wish I'd have took them out a long while ago when they were higher
Mm invested them somewhere else
Well yeahbut like you say you don't know do you
No
That's one of the things that you don't know about
Say I don't know what the latest price is on them but
They're being rude up that end
Are they
They're being rude
No
And you wouldn't be
No no
No as if you would
Yeah

Are you alright my darling

We need to oh no we don't
I need to go to the Co - o p and Ice land
What shall I get for your mother

I don't think she eats that much though
I know she's she doesn't eat that much but what she is eating i everything's sweet
Mm
Chocolates and
Is she eating them
Pardon
Does she eat though
Well sh I don't know
You know what the
She goes in the
staff are like
Mm
You know what those sa staff are like
I know
Most of them are well yes
But they certainly do
If anyone offered me a chocolate when I was nursing yes I would eat it cos I was always hungry
Which reminds me I meant to get weighed this morning before I had my breakfast
That don't matter
And I forgot
Remind me tomorrow
Before I eat anything
I think I'd better put some washing in before I go out
Are those ankle boots dry
That's all she's saying you couldn't it with these before if you
What
The boots you've got on
Give better support than the ones those flat heeled ones

For your Achilles' tend on
It's better now
I get on Wednesday I I did the er m Angel in e said to me don't do the high impact if you think it's going to hurt again
I co still have the support under it
I managed okay
It didn't hurt
Who's Angel in e
Which is the right one for
The pink one's a dish cloth
The blue one's the one I wipe up small stains off the floor
Right
I wonder how B ry on y is
What
I said I wonder how B ry on y is
And she wasn't very well yesterday
Every time she got a bump or knock off one of the others she was crying instead of clout ing them back
It must have been Richard I do I don't think Richard's very he
Sorry what d'ya say Richard was
I said I don't well stop running the tap
I say I don't think Richard's very well either
Cos he cried more than usual
I wonder what time the other night Trevor had with them on his own
What do you think of granny Jean offering it offering again to get Martin from school to save Trevor walking him home
Well it's well perhaps there's nothing in it for him
I don't know
I like her
Mm
I like her
Can I just r i rin se my thingy
And get my in
Ooh
I've got hand cream on my hands
That spur tle was used as a I can't
A
remember what Richard was using it as yesterday
Well he was poking me in the g ro in
What are we going to do about these til es for the step
I dunno
to cover this little hole in our path
I should hate to think what must be down there now
Tt
Oh
Well leave it cos it's it's
Well I told you that Fen wick s had and they were cheaper than
Cheaper
Fen wick s
but cheaper than what they call it
The place in the old place
Yes
They were cheaper
I got the price for you
Cheaper than the do - i t - y o u r s e l f shop up Brady's
They were both
But when can we get through to Newcastle
Well I well I'll have a week's holiday after Easter and I've gotta go unless we go to
And I've got a an all day meeting I've arranged it on the Tuesday that's if we're being presented to
Which Tuesday
After they break up
That's right
Which is this next Friday
Yes
So I hope to sort it out the Len ten appeal well
The what
The Len
L in
the Len ten's appeal at the schools that Mrs was supposed to let Miss know so she could get it off to the parents to get the money back so that they bought the scanner
See you didn't tell me about that
I did tell you
You didn't
All you told me go on ah only this one's
Miss wanted to
all you told me was that Miss was retiring
But I haven't to tell anyone
Which I haven't done
Which I don't intend to do
At the beginning of Lent Miss approached me
Yes
to see what she should do about the Len ten appeal
Aha
as she always does
Since I said why send money to Great Or mon d Street when there was plenty of children's things local
Yes
So I asked if we wanted anything
And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital
What good's a bed with no extra nurses
Well there are special beds
Oh you mean a bed
Well
Tt
D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be
Well she just asked about a bed so I told her that we were
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is
But why's
She di na she just said a bed and so
Yes
I told her there were special beds that we have are very useful in fact very necessary in some some cases and are painfully short of them
Aha
And a Ni mb as bed costs two thousand pound
And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of which costs a lot more
M hm
Something like five thousand
But I can't remember the name
Anyway I said I'd make enquiries as to what a is wanted
And I said there's a there's a new children's ward will open at the Wand s ber g h Hospital perhaps they would like something
I saw Mrs and Mrs said they were aiming to raise money for the scanner appeal
Yeah
But also they're going to have a an obstetric adult patient's department at the College Hospital for the very first time
A what
A
An obstetric out patients
Yeah
Yeah
and they're obviously they would be tend to be other children with mothers then so they would like perhaps a play facility there
And other children who go to the E N T clinic and go to the
or just go to the out patients in general and the casualty
Yes
there's very limited facilities for children to play
So but I also coaxed Mrs about the Wand s ber g h
Anyway she wanted to me to go and see her she said there we there was a scanner appeal and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible and because there was an arts appeal and for arts facilities at the hospital and all sorts of things
So I went back to Miss and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be she thought that that would be the best idea
Not the children's things at the Cottage Hospital
I also told her it's the diamond ju b i lee of the hospital and the children from will be invited to the hospital for that day that week sorry
It's gonna be a week
So she wanted to know what date it is
So I I asked Mrs to but would she write to Miss and give her all the details
And she said oh she'd be she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all
And that she was going on Wednesday I think
Up she went you know
Hold on
Which one was going to see which
It's
one
Mrs was going to see Miss
Was going to see Miss

Oh
I see
I didn't know which one
But I give them a so then I saw Mrs on Tuesday when I was at Ash ing ton
And she came up with all sorts of things that she would like for the the new Wand s ber g h development
But on a but there's nothing ready of course so th there'sthere's a giant sun dial they're going to have in one of the court yards and it's a giant one it's it's the the building and the blocks of things in in the in the courtyard that make up the the time
So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock and that one is nine o'clock and so forth
This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got
Hold on
Wha how where is it going to be seen from
I presume it's seen from the wards that are up behind looking down on to this courtyard
There's also er m a play are a for the the children's ward there's also some mural s on the the walls various artistic mural s
And of course they've got this grant from Art can for six thousand pound for a pro gg i e mat exhibition
A six thousand pound grant for a pro gg i e mat
Well
exhibition
well over over a period it's and other things too but they sa they said that mural s and pro gg i e mat s are involved in it
And various other art things
But also th the thought of a ga r a garden and the children keeping the garden up
But that's a apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here to the Wand s ber g h Hospital
But then I thought perhaps if that
I can't see the education committee with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here
Well they won't
to go Ash ing ton Hospital to do a
they won't so the they they
garden
the the the education committee and the school governors have no money at all
No
to pay for that
I would expect
But then
that's a very low priority
well it isn't even a priority it is nothing
They won't get the money
Th they won't pay for them to go swimming
Well I don't
they've gotta walk to go swimming
But I thought that now that the M S has acquired that bus and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time and it's a twenty nine seat er bus
I mean the seats come out so that wheel chairs can go in but in between times it's twenty seats you see
And then you'll need a P S V
Well
licence
but but that's that's that's easily remedied if you could get a er a driving licence holder to take them oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents or somebody who could take the children er periodic ally in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing
So that was a possibility
But I haven't seen Miss about all these sort of things
But I did also say to Mrs that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September that it might be better to discuss it with them after I've discussed with Miss
I only know one person I only know one bus driver with children
There's ambulance drivers
And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School
Er this letter from the Multiple S cl eros is
Yes
Says any
that says if you've got wheel chairs in you reduce your number of people
You're not
To sixteen
you're not reducing the size of the bus
Well I think that's crazy
And someone who's been just used to driving a car are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra
Well
tuition
Well I I
Whether it's got whether it's got sixteen people in it or twenty nine
Well er
it doesn't alter the length of the bus
I drive the mini bus at the hospital
I know
which only takes four wheel chairs and of course there's the drivers of of the mini bus things that bring them
I think I I would query that anyway that just
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
No
and just drive
But but
it
but I query as well whether just because you reduce the number of spa passengers in it that you you you don't need a P S V licence or the equivalent isn't a P S V licence but it's it's
Oh you do the they've looked into that
But it sounds doubtful to me
But anyway there's the insurance point of view
But anyway any I mean that's the easy and I mean if if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving before they take passengers out
I mean I didn't drive the mini bus until I'd driven it without passengers
Yeah
I mean I I I I drove the mini bus with only somebody in with me before I drove out with people in it
Didn't you da drive Dan cy Dag s
Oh yes I drove that but that was a long time ago that
Yeahbut yo you drove that one
I drove it to Ash ing ton and
Mm
You drive her to Ash ing ton in it
Yes
Er m do you think I should throw these roses out
They're
Aha
dead aren't they
I'm afraid so
It's a shame
Well they'll be forced for last Sunday
Pardon
They will be forced for last Sunday and that was
Oh I know
the air wasn't it
I know but they were dead by about Tuesday
The yellow one was dead by Tuesday
So what a shame
Never mind
Right I'll put my make up on
Have you decided where you want this umbrella tree
Er er
You need a saucer at the bottom
But they're never the right size for that it wants
Well there's a huge saucer on the old one
Ah but that's in it you can put one in that
Well
plant pot that's a different matter altogether
Jus just leave it there for now
Er m I'm going to put my make up on and think what I need from the shops
Right
It's ten o'clock love
I know
I'm gonna have to hurry up or you'll get no dinner
I'll take that upstairs with me
Ooh
My head feels a lot better
It's gotta be better
Oh
I don't
That er
I haven't had a a headache like this for a
Still it's much more quick
I know
I need some le er the I wanted a carton of live yo g hurt I don't think the live yo g hurt I used was any good because for a start it was fruit flavour ed no it wasn't it was natural but it said mild flavour ed
Mm
and I don't think it was the proper like the Greek style real live yo g hurt that would have
Mm mm
started all the fungus growing on it
It is beginning to look like a proper stone cup though
And they're saying that er okayI'll go and get ready
So do you want the yo g hurt yo g hurt before we go to the
I don't think it matters but if the weather's still going to be freezing at night
And if so does does
I've got the
the it's outside all the time anyway
I know but it's got the poly the ne bag round it still
I got it standing on that brick so it would drain
I wish I knew what to do with the other a z ale a
Some of the er m stem s on it look as if the not mould y but they'rethey're sort of
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put
green
another one in
Those hy ac in ths in the cauldron are taking a long time to come out aren't they
I know
I would have thought the tu lip that went in the er coal scuttle the tulips in the cauldron I thought they'd had it they were lying down completely
I know
They just straightened
They were
up
just grown up again
And those forget - m e - n o t s that are called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers they're coming out with er m tiny pin key purple y flowers
I know
If they're blue so am I
And then we've got miniature roses gonna come up one that's on it own that one with the
The wha
on the tub
Is there one in the tub
No
Yes
Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay it's the other one
M hm
I like the other best as well it's the peach one
When are you going to prune them
Well when I plant that other one where you want it planted that's
I wonder when er John 's going to have the er m
Wheelbarrow ready
Yes
Oh
Said in yesterday's paper that someone had had a wheelbarrow valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill
Where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible
So ours must have cost I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds
Mm
Cos it didn't it didn't say a wrought iron wheelbarrow or anything it just said a wheelbarrow
Well those er four tapes
So we'll have to get it

U r g h
This coffee's

I will miss that one
That er er i information centre
Oh yes
Ah yes
Right well have you
That's it
sorted anything out about the oranges
Aha
Yes
Er m I've got a letter saying that it's er th the mayor the is it sixteen fifteen pounds worth of o of er
Oranges
oranges is gonna be issued in the place we say that that er er at two o'clock if it's wet we'll be in the
the pavilion
Oh
Which is like next door
I had the Ro tar ac term they said they'd probably be offered er er one of these castle things er jumping castles from
Oh
Did you see those on the news yesterday
Aye
I see yeah
They can cause a lot of apparently
Adults and children
Yeah
injuries
I fell off one the week before last at the soft play but it wasn't blown up quite enough
Oh I see
And as I s te
Well there's no carpe the said there's just
Well there was
there's a great you know the big heavy er m foam thing but it kept slipping away
All the morning I kept pushing it back again
Aye
Yeah
They
Er
couldn't tell me I suppose
and it a it had happened to of slipped away at that time and I went to step off and with it not being blown up properly that's how it just flattened and I went off sid I've still got a big bruise on my left knee
Well er m the only
So I I do not jump on any more
the only trouble with that sort of thing i is again if you ever get any wet on it because
Mm
Mm mm
Oh well
And there's certainly some
So the mayor's taking out the oranges
And er
So they've got they've got it back now so it's got nothing to do with us
No I don't suppose thank you
Er
Do you work
No
Mm
No er m basically er I think for the anyhow Trevor will be coming in so we'll we just s t try and stay a little more to see what happens at the end
But er m
See they handed it over to us and but they didn't wanna you know it was very when what they call them
Er m
It was Temple wasn't it la last year
Aye Temple was but it it was a good job because we had no oranges and they had to go and break in
It's alright now
Yeah
Was that the year the oranges were horrible
Er
I've
Yeah
they were Seville oranges I'm sure they were
Well they've they've been nice
Seville oranges
Aye
They've never been really nice
Yeah
Well I don't know where they're getting them from but I mean that's what they say
Well that year
And they've got Round Table laid on to help and they want help from the from us
So they want us to go around at half past one or the two of them can start cos we've got an addition
Well it worked
Er I'm just wondered you know wi with because they came to expect it and we we didn't know
And they'd handed it over to us and then obviously they wanted it back but then
Well I think it's like everything else I think that er with with Lawrence being off they're just sort of meeting everything as a crisis and getting getting
Well if you're at work
Yo you see as well to go with what you call them
Er
he he
Didn't
he didn't want anything to do with it you see
That's where and he's not from he's not from this end so had er no real interest for him I don't think
If you're at work Dorothy could go If I help I'll help with Trevor with his trip lets
Well you can go and get their oranges and the
Yesbut it's he he couldn't possibly push that buggy
around that field
But it isn't in the fields though
it's up beside the
It's it's
it it's Carlisle Park
Oh
That's
Because
better
because the the the pa the er
Oh
Because of that le a
The Easter Field is is
leaking
It's got a
Yes
So it can't be used
Right
But I presume that we do turn out if we do it right in the middle
Well in actual fact people who turned out were I so bel and me and er what they call him
Er one who goes on
Er from Lon s de ne
Er Fred
Fred
No
Fred
No Jack's not very well
Well I helped you one year
Oh yes
cos there was only
Yes
there was only you and somebody else
Well the year I was chairman
Th the er the year I was wi I was chairman we were both there
There was one child came up about seventeen times
Oh yes
I think
Er m down it was down here remember
I know
That was the year the oranges were horrible maybe his mother was making mar ma lade
The only thing about er is that the Ro tar act one tentatively mentioned about the
Well that's it
I mean th tha when we took it over we we got that cos people said well you know just dish ing out the oranges wasn't there should be something organized so Ro tar act said they would do we said we would give the money towards the prizes
So that they wouldn't hate us
Well when er the the the there's two words the charter and what's the other word
There's two things to do with
Food and jar that's right
Yeah
Well well Bar len Bar len
Bar len and
Yeah
Yeah
I can't say that properly
Those words aren't used where I come from
And er er
Mind I use words that Jim doesn't
the the Ro tar act er presents this year that they're towards so he's been quite pleased
M hm
So they'll they'll be done
And Round Table it says has laid on for the
Well Round Table a er have never that's the first time then
We got
Well it's
because cos it's Ro tar act who's always
It must be the borough involved with the
M hm
But I'm er
But they were keen
I mean I they they've they've they did work didn't they
With with the games and things when when we were there
Yes
And it was a reasonable day too
I know all the children
I mean we thought it'd rain this year so it's more
Yeah
likely to be a better day then
And ee all the kids ended up with a prize didn't they
Oh eventually yes
I mean th the
Yeah they
they were that had bigger to ones
The winners got
Who supplied those then
Out of the money that we gave them
Oh
The
Yes
I see it was and that was what Ro tar act did
Yes
Yes
They had big eggs well you know sort of the
Aha
Smart i es type egg so about so big
for the prizes
Ah
and the others got little C ad bury 's
Ah
Creme Eggs
Which rem i reminds me I've got to get some for all they spare children before
Yes
well
before they ran out
It's surprising actually cos th the more the more common ones do run out because of course th the other ones are a bit pricey
The bloom ing Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round and then they run out at Easter
That's happened I couldn't get any one year I took the trip lets to the er m Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tomb ola and one of them won a Creme Egg
but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag and er it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some I I can't remember what we were doing afterwards so I gave it to his mother I thought she could share it
Mind by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between those three and their older brother
Yeah
There's not much of it left
No but I could have seen a there'd be an almighty tantrum s from the other two if J i er
Aha
James had had it
I can imagine
Mm
Mm
Is there anything much for the agenda for a week on Tuesday
Not a great deal
I mean what I'll
Yeah
do is we'll get rid of those couple of things left over
M hm
and er basically it's Peter's got the one coming which is er put the ducks in the river
Mm
Er he's doing the a and what I'm er sug suggesting
Aha
like well apparently the fella that's done it for years and years for years for years has had a
M hm
and he's he's just k e you know what I mean I think he's he's getting an extension so that's why there's a bit of delay on that
M hm
And it's where that lot meet
I've been counting them since
Well how much I mean
I read the letter in the paper
how much was he paying
It was sum mat like er I dunno it was sum mat like five hundred pound a year
It was quite modest
Mm
Er
There were thirteen
But
drake s cha er chasing one duck er just past the baths along the promenade
And then we sat at the far side of the Old Gate bridge and er an old lady came along and said and she was counting them but she said just look at that things he counted seven although in actual fact by then th these dr a the seven drake s had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down
And a there was a domestic one in each group there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen and there was another white one near Old Gate Bridge
Did he cu ll them as well
Yeah apparently so
Yes
Did he feed them
Cos there's there was there used to be fe feed put down for that as well
Well to be honest it seems to I Peter's got the details cos he's been talking to er the public health clerk
M hm
But it's it's it's it sort a it's I think carrying through from the old borough days
That's right
and somebody ha er m nobody really knew a great deal about it so I think he's been doing some research on that
That's the one paper that is a bit er maybe a bit so but th I'll have to check with the N R A because of course er the river
Mm
er policing is their responsibility
It is
They they've not they'll not do that
No
No
But I mean we really we've gotta make sure that they haven't got any objections
But of course in the meanwhile of course we've had a flood
Yes
And it's going to kill most of the
Yes
eggs wash most of the nests away I was thinking yesterday
It's bloody incredible actually
We always get extreme
Well that's it wasn't a obviously as high as the flood twenty seven years ago
No
But was pretty near
It was getting near
But of course the higher standards they've got no protection cos they didn't want what was offered
They didn't want a bank
Well that's right
Er none whatsoever
It was
a raised footpath that was before
Yeah
this wasn't it
Than than the bridge right round
Which is what we're doing at at the Wand s beck inn it
So we'll put a we'll put a bank in very deliberately at the first level
M hm
er m and went right the way through with it did look it doesn't look bad at all it was
Yeah well no it didn't
I mean this looks well there's nothing else they could do here
It doesn't look il ugly but I mean it it it's not attractive
No
but it's
but but but they've got protection
But I mean er that one lent itself to that
That's right
Yes
Yes
It would have been ideal
But you see now of course that was when there were River
Yeah
River Authority days and
Yeah
that was quite good
Er m it was quite useful er they you could get things done now
Mm
now it's nothing
Well they just put
I came along the river path when I came home from shopping
Sitting in the the sand damp sand under the bridge
Mm
You never saw that one that would er you know the one on the Bedford Road because Bedford Road has a
Well they that's right
I mean
Yes
there's nothing can be done than the
No
nothing at all
M hm
M hm
But er ah you know it gets up into the garden but I don't think it it's got anywhere near the house er this time cos I was up there on Thursday and I you could see where it had been but it was and I mi I'd have got very worried about er
But you could actually put a bag all the way and tie it into tie it into er the it's the S killer y Bridge that one
Yes the S killer y Bridge
And
yeah
you just sort of tied up the
Well
Yes wellthat's where we'll have to go from there
I think
round but
There were wild rumours flying around on Wednesday I was told
They didn't want to
by several people that the S killer y had gone
In
But it hadn't no
It survived
Well Jim Jim saw the children going back to er school after swimming
Oh
over it on Thursday afternoon but er
But there was a lot of debris up against it and high up against it
Yeah
So they could see how bad
Was Fold Cottage flooded
It was bound to be
It didn't
Ann
Bound to be
I thought they built a wall around it the
No
last people who bought it
Yeahbut even on that you see yo yo you know yo you're never really stuck with it I mean
No
once you're in the clear you really it's the silliest in the world to have a little actually
Yeah
Well this who is must be related to David anyway er m they bought the house facing the o is it Old Cross Old Gate bridge and has spent a lot of money on doing it up li just over three million of course the whole of the downstairs was flooded today
Is that Mrs 's
Yes that's right
The one
Yeah
facing her that's right
Yes
Aha
It's called Au bern House is it
That's right
That's right
It's Au bern it's bigger than Au bern Place on the left
No it's it's not it's called something Cottage actually
Au bern is the one round the corner
Ah
Oh
A yeshe must have lived around the corner but she was the
Cos she was only the only one I'm th i
The first one I'm sure is something Cottage
It might be Au bern Cottage but but the one round the corner the new er one not the stone one
Aye
the stone one
Cos he used to live in that one

Yes
Yes
Yes he did
Before the
Ah
Well Stan was a he looked like Cliff Michel more didn't he
Stan
The original Stan
Aye
And he and I remember a her er I mean I was only well I was sort of and he had his feet up on the table he was smoking a cigarette and he and he had a laid back attitude
Oh yes definitely
But we we got our mortgage from from the council you know obviously
Aha
because it's our it's Ann was pregnant then didn't s mo and she didn't smoke so
And I I gave up smoking when I was pregnant
So do you smoke
No
I don't smoke
Er m d'ya drink
Not really
Er m have you got any hire purchase goods
No
The the cook er which we were buying quarter ly can't have a mortgage
It was it was the
They say they won't believe that
The cook er was three pounds a quarter
He says they won't believe
And he let
they you can't have it I'll put you down as a moderate drinker
We couldn't afford to drink
We were de stitute in those days
We didn't know at the time but I wasn't working
Couldn't have a mortgage
and we were actually living living below the poverty line
If I'd read er m i if I'd read properly all the instructions in the back of the er book
Yeah
I would have got fo er m free orange juice free vitamin drops
Yeah
and free milk for G are th
Yeah
But Jim was a charge nurse
Goodness only knows what staff nurses did then
Jim was a charge nurse it never occurred to us that we were living before below the poverty line
Yeah
I meaner
You probably still are
I know we're
Possibly
no we're a we'rewe're
we do we do live on
we don't live on so much er m
Ah
b roth and er
we used to have I used to make big pan of b roth you could get gorgeous bacon bones with plenty bacon on in the Co - o p in those days it were wi it was when they they did all the boning in the shops and you could go get good meat y bones and I used to
I used to fill it full of vegetables
and barley so and
Yeah I know
and split pe as
But er it was po possibly a healthier diet actually than we have now
Aye
Well of course this is it I mean you just
It was quite fat free anyway
When you when you look and you see how people survived and of course they delivered the that you I mean like we had dripping and bread
Oh yes
Yes
That's a real that's
Terrible thing isn't it
Yes
You read books like er m Lark Rise to
Yeah
Candle ford and there they went breakfast was bread and dripping and
Mm
It used to taste nice
Oh
I liked it
I gave my a
a few years ago when my sons were teenagers I had some nice dripping and I said you've never had bread and dripping and I gave them some I put a bit of salt on I said try this I loved a bit of med bread and dripping when I was your age
And they took a mouthful and u r g h
U r g h
Mm
And we when how old were they when we went to Whit ley for a holiday
And I saw some liquor ice root and I said oh
Look Jim
Right
I haven't seen that for years
I used to buy that for a ha ' penny
During the war time
a ha ' penny for two sticks
And I got them some of that u r g h u r g h
Mm
They thought it was horrible
So there was I walking round Whit ley chewing this liquor ice root
Just look as if you were spitting tobacco
I didn't like the locus t beans though
Nah
But it
And I loved a pen north of a pen north of k ari e lick your finger and dip that in
Yeah
I know they call it s her bet now but it's not the same it was sort of er m
it's like sugary
We never saw sweets in those days
Oh well there was the sweets were on the ration ing and and they
Mm
were they very very few to get
Was it two ounces a week we got
And that was only after the war er in
Mm
Scotland anyway
That's right
Yes
Yeah
Oh yes
I used to get my my tea cakes
Well I didn't know what bananas were
I mean I knew what they looked like from pictures
Yeah
but I never
No
never had a taste
Just no no
Well I
I
I obviously had just before the war but I don't don't didn't remember then until afterwards
I knew what a pineapple
And oranges
looked like because we had er m
a black leaded no we had one of these black leaded grates you know with
Aye
oven at the side
Ah yeah
and there was a pineapple on the oven door
Oh
Yeah
The first
I mean
oh we I I got dried ban a we had dried bananas Jim
Ah but you were
I was under five
You were under five
I wasn't
And my bro
I was the youngest I was just five
My brother and I got dried bananas
when war broke out
and we also got peanut butter because we were under five
Ah
But er m
the first bananas I saw my
Luxury is peanut butter
My great aunt had a sho
Yeah
They
a fruit shop
You wouldn't touch the stuff now would you

I like bananas
Mind you I bet you don't touch peanut butter then
Er m just very occasionally in the school holidays
er m at lunchtime I don't have many children at school holidays because apart from one of them all of them have one or both parents who are teachers
Aha
so I have Sallyand and er her mum always cooks a meal in the evening so I I do something like toasted cheese sandwiches or beans on toast or something like that at lunch time but there was one time when she wanted peanut butter and all her brother used to ask I her brother doesn't come to me now he stays at home cos he's going on fifteen and as he's next door but one anyway you know if if anything goes wrong he can come along to me but all he wanted was my homemade black currant jam and now he doesn't come any more I've got to actually give him
Send some round
I give him the black currant jam I give My rene the black currant jam jam to take home for him
He loves it
Yeahthat's right
I remember you saying
If you will be in dust rio us
Mm mm mm
Oh I like I qui I quite like making jam
And it would be absolutely sac rile gi o us to to buy hot cross buns
Oh well
Yeah
Oh do no I
Oh
No there are certain things that I just couldn't do
I couldn't buy a Christmas pudding and I couldn't buy a hot cross bun
It I think it's too ingrained in me from my grandmother and my mother
You know you made your Christmas pudding s everybody had to have a wish when they stirred them
I better see if this dinner's ready
Bye
Bye
Hey you know talking about the ducks on the river you know that elderly ever so refined lady
Who brought bread to feed
Yes
the ducks
Yes
Yes wellthat's right
I think she must have been quite well off some time had fallen on really hard times
I mean she told me oh a couple of years ago that she was eighty
And I better get this dinner out
And er m she always thought of her husband as daddy
M hm
And her daughter I think she must have been getting on because around the time she told me that she was eighty she happened to mention that her daughter was forty
She had no grandchildren
I know her daughter er her daughter's not married
Well I haven't seen her feeding the ducks for about three or four months
I wonder if she's died or she's ill
She's always going to jumble sales
I know
All all her clothes came from jumble sales
Everything
She wa she was buying long after nylon shirts went out of fashion there we there was a pile of nylon shirts and she said I'm I'm just looking to see if this if these will be suitable for daddy
I can't remember er she gave me the reason why she wanted these for oh he he he always wears his cuffs out or something
She was quite pleasant to talk to I liked listening to her
I don't think I know her name
So I couldn't even ask anyone
Are you ready for your dinner
I've made the tea
I forgot to put those in the freezer
I think I'll do the bedrooms this afternoon
Especially B ry B ry on y 's bedroom
And those beg on i as are doing well now
Which
Where
In the front room
Yes
How many have grown
Er
Sometimes you look at them
It doesn't matter you don't need to look
Get on with your dinner
You'll be late
Mm
There's four in the sitting room there's one well advanced that's do i doing quite well there's one upstairs that's just about ready for er re pot ting and there are two more that have sprout s on
Only
So that's seven out of ten was it
Oh yeah
Yeah
About seven
Well that's not bad for one ninety nine
There's er m I know they'd be probably be better quality but there are nine I think it is advertised in today's paper that sayer m for er eleven ninety nine
So even we get seven for one ninety nine it's a bargain
Depends what they flower like though
I hope they're different colours
And how long they last
And if we
Well they go on flowering for quite you you've got
No no I mean how long you put
Oh yeah you'll have to le leave the children's
I know that
But if we keep them for the next ten years they're a a real bargain ififif
Aha
they're all no good next year well it'll be just a an ordinary bargain
I don't think I dunno that I wonder if we should put some grave l under that um b umbrella tree
Or if it should even be near that radiator
In Australia you know they grow into great big huge trees in Australia Mrs told me
Yes
She said er Derek has them in his garden
Well it's a bit better climate out there

He told me he applied but I thought he told me he'd been turned down
Well I never heard the well he had applied once before and he he got as far an interview and then he didn't get any further
But then he applied just last summer for the Metropolitan
Yeah
Cos er er m
I haven't heard the outcome of that
Marie Marie was going down to her mother's she was running as usual she da shed up to our back door and said is Doug around
And I said I don't know what shift he's on is his car out

And I said do you want a piece of paper to write him a message or something
And she said no it was just that he's talking of renting his house er m and I know of someone who wants to rent one
Oh
So I said well where's Doug going
Then she said something about June and the Met
Oh well Doug wasn't here again he never mentioned it
Or did she say he's going for an interview in June for the Met or something anyway
Well he's not
Cos I I haven't seen him at all
I walked up from the woods with him came
Mm
together he never mentioned it
In fact I thought it must be all finished with because he he was quite talkative about it during the summer
Yes
A well I remember a well I was I was sure
then I and he said to me about
being turned down
Oh
Cos he hoped if he got into the Met and then he transfer up here
Oh
You see like it's like 's grandson
Yes
I mean he started off in the Met er did his training and everything and then I think he's up here somewhere now
I tell you someone er m our boiler went wrong on ah I think it was Wednesday
Oh
Thursday I just can't remember and Raymond came through
Yeah
it must have been Thursday because I didn't want him to come I said to Jim tell him not to come we'll just turn the whole lot off
But the kitchen was reeking of
mm
fumes
And and
Oh dear
er I could feel it prick ling the back of my nose and my throat
Yes
and and my eyes started to water
M hm
I opened the windows
Oh
And there was when it came on in the afternoon there was this tremendous very loud roar
Now it sometimes goes whoosh
Yes
When they
It comes on in it i ally
Yes
And dies down
and it immediately dies down and then it's okay but there was this tremendous roar and a loud click and it went out
And it was only about we i it was wi within a couple of minutes or probably less Jim came in er I think he was I don't know where he'd been cos his day off was Thursday I think
Yes he was
And I told him about it and he said oh yes the pilot light has gone out and he re lit it
And it was fine
It sounded okay but we kept getting these fumes
So we kept opening the door it blew out once again and he put it on again and we were still getting these fumes till about oh about half past five it seemed to stop u we had the windows open
Mm
And then Raymond phoned at about quarter to seven
No
He didn't
Sorry
Sorry
It we he phoned at it was it was five to six Jim was going to take me to aerobics because of the weather
Mm mm
I had my well i es in case the leisure centre was flooded
Ha
There was only ten of us there
Anyway er m Raymond was on the phone because he was t al and I was saying to Jim tell him I don't want him to come if the ra if the road's cut off to B ly the I don't want him to get stuck I mean he's got a wife
and two small children at home
And I'm saying it's time I was out I'm gonna be late
Anyway he insisted he was coming at half past seven
And he came at half past seven and he cleaned it and he looked at it and he said er it wasn't anything that he could see he thinks it was just down dr aught but we've had winds before
And he said that the c owl we've got on that chimney
Yes
off the kitchen and r u and runs the boiler he said it's the best kind you can get nothing should come in there
And as he's driven up at the back then he looked up and he said you ca you could see daylight through it so it was wasn't blocked by anything
Wasn't blocked
Er m but he said
D'ya think it was the rain maybe
I don't know
Driving wind
I said could it have been continuous rain
And he said something about he'd once they'd once had to work all one day and all one night a near the Regent Centre because er something had gone wrong with the gas pipes because er m of flooding
Oh
Right
So whether we've but nobody else seems to have noticed anything like this
No I I haven't had anything like that
Anyway he couldn't find anything
He said we'll just have to leave it and if it happens again we'll have to go into it further but it hasn't happened again so now it's okay
Mm mm
Except last night I thought what on earth's this
It just smelt like Christmas cake cooking and I wasn't cooking anything at all
I mean Jim went to work at one o'clock and the last of the kids went home I've had my dinner
Perhaps something's melting then
at mid day
But i it was no it was no stronger in the kitchen than the living room
Mm
I sniffed around the boiler I sniffed around the cook er
ah but when the kids went home I just had ha I had a sandwich
Mm
That's all I had I hadn't cooked anything
M hm
Er m the trip lets had soup and s tot tie and I warmed that up in the microwave
Mm mm
And this smell lasted for about half an hour and thenthen I couldn't smell it again
And it disappeared
It's what kind of boiler is that you have
Er ooh

It's one of these that uses less fuel
More efficient
Well we've had it how long have we had it
About threefour years

That's right
and I sat them on the floor
and they sat and listened then
How old are the trip lets

M hm
B ry on y especially tends to drink small amounts
M hm
But you leave the cup on the table and she'll call you back every ten
She keeps going back
minutes for a sip

But of course they were picking the bottle up and they were trying to tip it as well
So I'll have to get some straw s and we'll have to pr act ise

Aren't they bent straw s or not

Away

Mm
the others came
Well we just got out into the hallway where all these mothers were standing round and
Yes
Richard threw himself on the floor screaming
Ee
He wasn't going home
Oh dear
And I was try and he he of course he's he's heavy
Yes
and when he just makes himself flop he wouldn't stand up
When I tried to sit him up
Pick him up
to put his coat on I picked him up and tried to carry him and he just flung himself around so hard I had to put him down and he immediately flung himself on the floor again
Oh
Lovely exhibition
Oh
Golly
Anyway
And was it because he didn't want to leave
Yes
Oh
He was staying there
And we I was I was trying to explain to him that er m we've had to go home the teachers were clearing everything up
Yeah
all the children were going home
For lunchtime
because there were different children coming in the afternoon
Mm
But no no
So I picked him up and I carried him Dorothy had gone out the wrong door instead of going out the door at that end she'd gone right along this long corridor
And come out the main door
so I followed her and of course we're going past all the bloom ing classrooms
And the
Yeah
classrooms all had their doors open
Yeah
Yeah
And anyway I carried him half way along and I had to put him down
Mm
I managed to get his coat on and a woman came along I I don't know if she was a dinner lady or what she had a a sort of overall on and er I said come on let's catch up with your mummy and she said ah
Are these trip lets
Are these
M hm

Aha
And I said yes
And she said oh Mr teaches my son at school
Oh
She said come along hold my hand as well and er I'll tell my son tha that that er Mr 's son took me to the door
So he shut up
and listened to her
Oh
He'd calmed down tha
Yeah
by then
Well I had trouble
with Joshua on er m what day will it be
Er m it must have been the last day it must have been Friday must have been Friday
Cos usually he's keen to go to Ron and Stephanie's
M hm
He wouldn't get in his push chair
He wouldn't put his coat on
Er m I finally got his coat on and then I said come on we'll walk
No
No
And chuck his hat down on the kitchen floor
I said well I'd have to go and leave you then
So of course he got up I went to close the door he was there so I tried him in his push chair I says well you'll have to walk I know it's only five minutes away
So
M hm
it was a bad day
So er he wouldn't move
Got so far on he stood and he started crying and yelling and don't want to go
Want to go home
Don't want to go
Now I used to get him along there and then he was sort of in tears but there was kids in the hall the little hall and then when you sort come in the door not the main door the one the
Yes
door you're supposed to come in
The one we should have go gone in
Yeah
and come out of
Well immediately on the left there's a door an and the hall goes along by the path that you you come up to that door
Yes
And the children were in there er m doing their P E and er he went stood at the door and watched them and he was quite happy
And they all filed out and the the caretaker I presume started putting the tables up and the chairs for lunch
M hm
and er he wouldn't keep out so so in the end the caretaker got him a little chair
M hm
and sat him against the wall
He said that's your chair now you can watch me
Well he sat there as good as gold
The only trouble was when Stephanie come out he didn't want to come home
Oh
It was difficult
It's a lovely nursery isn't it
I haven't actually been in to I've only ever got as far as the
They've got every kind of toy and equipment you can think of

The friend was er m pushing her and she came home with a big bump on her head

They drop Jessie off at her door next door they drop somebody else two or three doors downer they'll stop anywhere
Oh that's fine
And they run every er m
And the yeah
five minutes I think it is
Mm
Their grandma said to me yesterday have you worked out how you're going to get to nursery
And I said well yes I'll just walk up and I'll get the mini bus back
And she said will you manage
But I've had them on buses several times just when I when I'm going on a bus
Well now the occasions
It won't be a special treat any more once they're coming back from nursery three times a week on a bus will it
That's right
That's right
Yeah
Er m I mean I go up there
And probably when I was
at half past eleven but that's when Gillian 's on doing the manager's job which is nearly twice a twice a year
Er m
Yeah
She's just like a week ago she was she did the manager's job and she drops she brings Joshua down here for about quarter to nine then she goes back up to Stop Hill with the girls
Mm
takes them to school
M hm
And then Paul takes me up to their house where I usually about ten past eleven gives me time to get the push chair put up again and
sorted out and then I just walk along and pick up Stephanie
Er m so I was there at the odd occasions when I can give you a lift up but the they'll be very odd
Yeah
They'll be very odd
And then I stay there you see
Yes
I stay there then
Aha
Er m until Gillian because she she doesn't finish till five when she's doing the manager's shift
Aha
Five
So er m but that's only about three times a year at the most
Yeah
Have I seen you since er m I haven't seen you to talk to for very long have I
No well I I tend to keep away at nights when I cos I think er m those trip lets so you must be
absolutely worn out and ready for peace and quiet
Cos I know what it is myself with I mean they're different ages but and they're independent but it's wearing
Well it's
Questions all the time
d'ya know it's funny on a Wednesday when I go when they've gone home and I've ti died up a bit
M hm
and gone straight to aerobics for six o'clock
Mm
I feel quite fit by the time I get back you know by the time I've done
the aerobics you sho I should be feeling absolutely knack e red
Absolutely
But I'm not
I fe I fe I feel you know
Full of beans
I feel full of beans and quite
hungry by then
Well I when I come back from Stop Hill when I've been on a long shift till five o'clock I'm whacked because their bungalow is so warm
Yes
and it really it drains
Mm
It's like Jim at work he's shattered when he comes in
Ee
I come here
I sit down I ya w n and it comes to bedtime and I'm really too tired to go up the stairs
Mm
I feel absolutely and I think thank goodness I'm back in my dr aught y old house
Wha oh dear
I never feel cold in your house
Well it's alright if you know if you're in a room where the fire's on although I have had the heating on er m a few days recently because of the cold
But I was hoping it was off for good er but it didn't work out that way cos of the weather
Er m I thought I'll try and save a bit of gas this month
This quarter
But er m and I I got my er microwave and I'm trying to save some electric
I've been doing most of my cooking with the
Aha
rather than putting a big oven on
Yes
And if some er jus it was very thin slices of beef topside of well I thought I'll get some beef out and I did it in the microwave and it cooked but it was it was quite tough
I think if I'd had er no teeth I wouldn't have been able to manage at all or if I had
You might have slightly over cooked it
That's what he said
It's you tend to start with you do tend to er m
Yeah
over cook things
Yeah
Well it there wasn't a recipe to cover just what I was doing with the
I know i i it
and it was just a case of er m pot luck I would sort of brought it out and looked at it and er no it wasn't cooked it was cooked on the edges so I turned it over and turned it round and put it back in again
Did you let it stand
Yes
For a while after
Yes
Yes
Yeah
Before it carries on
Er it was
It's like when you cook
it was cooked
cakes they look as if they're not quite cooked
M hm
but by the time they've stood for five minutes they are
Well
Did you remember if you cook a cake and you put a piece of er m kitchen paper over the top
M hm
I don't
Oh
I I can't remember where I got I remember telling Be ry l that a long
Oh
time ago
Right
Well I
well before she knows
well I've cooked a
Someone who told me round about that
a cake recipe
time
The other thing is yes
but it was to me it was more like a er m er er a sponge er m like a pudding sponge
Yes
What
Er
kind of a cake did you make
It was just a plain er m Victoria
Oh
sponge recipe
Chocolate cakes are are very nice if
But I didn't have a proper tin
you do brown but use brown sugar
Yes
I made a pudding actually
And u and dark brown
A pudding
sugar
I that's nice and
Yeah
mo ist
But when you when you time when the cooked cake 's finished cooking
Mm
if you leave it for two minutes
Mm
run a knife round
M hm
tip it up on to your hand just briefly
Mm
just for a second and then
M hm
back a again
Yes I did
Let's the air go and get underneath
Yes
and that helps the bottom to dry out quicker
Yeah
Now someone else told me and it worked and if you just lay a piece of kitchen paper over the top that absorbs some of the moisture
The moisture
as well and ta and the top isn't so soggy
Mm
Well I didn't have
But chocolate cakes are definitely the best
Well I did a chocolate pudding
In the microwave
and it was lovely
Er m
Yes
but this cake that I made er m we thought was more like a a pudding and I
Yeah but they're so
put jam on it
they're so pale as well
and the next day it it was sort o like a rockwell not
The o
exactly but it was pretty
the only cakes I make in er m in a microwave are chocolate cakes
And are they alright the next day
Yes
They're a lot mo is ter if you if you use dark brown sugar
Yeah
they definitely are a lot more mo ist
Mm mm
And as long as you don't over over cook them
Mm
M hm
And I'll tell you what I always do
But what what do you make them in
Er like a a deep er f lane rm
I've got these you know the very thin microwave dishes
They're getting a bit battered now
Plastic
They're very thin plastic
No
I haven't got
They're about
any plastic ones
Th I got them in the electricity board there three for sixty pence
Oh
You're only I think you're only supposed to use them for a a few months I've been using them for about three years
M hm
M hm
Er they've got a dimple in here and there
M hm
But er
Cos it's a my recipe said a a
a so u f f le dish
Well I'd smashed
Yeah
my so u f f le dish
But I had I I I never thought I have a casserole dish which is about the the same height as the
M hm
so u f I could have done it in there
That might help
but I didn't I did it my p y rex bowl
Yeah
which of course the bottom is narrow er than the top
Yes
And it came right up like that
Ah
Ah
and it come over the top
These things are about so high
S males
Yeah
have a lot of microwave dishes
Yeah
They're about that wide and they're about that deep and I just put a circle of grease proof in the bottom
M hm
don't grease them or anything
Oh just put the grease proof in
Ju I just lay a piece of grease proof in the bottom
Oh
Now I grease mine and er I put the grease proof in
I don't grease them I just put this I've got a pile of little circles of grease proof paper ready cut to to fit the
bottom of the
Ohwell you're well organized

baked potatoesand er it makes lovely er m custard
Yes
Lovely custard
Er
And
the only thing is I haven't got a big enough jug so I have to do half quantities
I make mine I make my my custard in er m er I think it is it's a casserole about so wide it's my biggest casserole
Oh right
It's in a about
It's a round one about that far across
about a three pint
Er er nearly two pint I think
Two pint

It's about this shallow
Oh well I put
I found itititit seems to cook quicker
Yeah
Oh I could be using that that
Er m the last time
casserole dish
I made half a pint of white sauce in the measuring jug I
Mm
boiled it all over the place
The last time I made about half a pint of bread sauce I lost half the bread sauce all over it
Oh well I can do half a pint successfully but I've gotta watch
Yeah you need to stir it every minute or so
Yes
I have to I have to watch it
Er I can do half a pint
And you don't
quite well
no you know your er m smoky glass beakers
Aha
don't use those in
Oh no

Nancy used one of those in it and she just lifted it out and the whole lot shattered all over
Che e ee
the place
Yes
But I read you know when you make your coffee in it
M hm
Well Paul makes his in there
Give it a stir first
It's just recently I read about this it's not getting air into it or something is the reason it ex it can suddenly shoot up all over you
Oh it's in my book yes it can come
Well I always
up
I put the coffee my milk powder and the water in
Aha
and stir it anyway

M hm
and then put it in and it's so far it's been okay

Well mine's a M ou line x
When this wears out I'm gonna
I got it
get rid of this one
I got it cheap at the Co - o p at Lyme
I went to Argo s to get this particular M ou line x
Yeah
And they didn't have it in there they just had the the touch oven ultra er m is that on
Yeah
Tt
Oh
God
Er m and it was quite expensive
Er m and so I said no I can't afford that cos I sold my shares you see
Yeah
I'm glad I did they've gone right down
Have you noticed
Yes
Er m so Paul says come on we'll have a look in the Co - o p and here they had the very same one I wanted in the Co - o p and it was ten pound cheaper
Well you know when we got our Va x vacuum cleaner
Yes
that was ten pounds cheaper than Argo s
Really
So er we got that at the Co - o p
It was
Really
a hundred and forty nine
Yes
in or a hundred and forty nine ninety nine or whatever it was I can't remember in er m Argo s
M hm
and it was ten pounds cheaper in the Co - o p
Well
But so we got it there
this is what we found cos I said oh
There was something else you know when I got the when I got my food processor
M hm
that was something like eighty pounds I can't remember exactly
M hm
but for some reason we'd been to Gates head and I'd looked up food processor s in the Argo s catalogue
M hm
and the Index Little woods
Mm mm
catalogue and we were in Argo sI mean sorry we're in Gates head and we I know I was trying to get er m a very pale peach wallpaper for for the
Oh right
bathroom to match the very very very extremely pale peach
I know
flowers that we've got
Yeah
on so many til es
Yes
and I couldn't get any
And we've looked in M aw per sand we've Newcastle and Jim said let's go to Gates head
I can't somebody had a sale on in Gates head so we went there and then we went to the Co - o p a n d of course I got the exact paper I wanted just sort of this mot t ley mot t ley mar b ly pale peach
Mm mm
paper
And we looked at er m food processor s
M hm
and we got the food food processor it was cheaper than Argo s and Index
Mm mm
I got a free there was a free electric carving knife with it
Oh
Right
plus at the time there was five percent extra off er m cos Jim's got a a Co - o p gold card
M hm
and if you got it through this gold card there was another five percent off so or something like that off
Yes
So we got a real bargain there
Oh
You got you got quite a few
Yeah
bargain s didn't you
Yeah
Oh I'm very careful with my money
I always
Yeah
check if them things are cheaper first
Well er m I do most things in it if I can

Has somebody started up in business
I wondered if it was
Oh
Don't mention the
I'd love to slaughter that child
Were you having trouble with them the other night
Having trouble
Did you not hear about when they broke the thing
Well I I went out to them and because I heard banging and I looked out the window and they were hacking at my fence and I went out bu and was playing war with them when Jim crossed the road with one of them following behind and away down the street and I thought oh
Jim must have had trouble
And
He
then when I was in the kitchen I saw Mr go to your door later
Yeah
one night
And I've gone out it wasn't that was hacking my fence mind er mit was another boy I didn't know him with a and I went out and I I and he said I wasn't
I says yes you were
And that chap that lives two below Mrs they haven't been in very long with
Yes

Aha
He came out the curtain and swore at him
And he said yes you were
He says I saw you
So I says right get away from my property
And they'd hacked two or three of the er m the wood er m stave s on the fence
M hm
Now when I came back from Stop Hill the other night must have been oh must have been Thursday cos Paul er m was going out with Al ec and then they were going to Al ec for dinner and when I came back one of the er m wooden stave s was off here had been prized off
Cos Paul put it on the next day
So a couple of nights
One of ours was off as well
couple of nights later I looked down and here's three of them boy somebody else and another
one and one was sitting on my fence there so I banged on the window and said get off the fence
Er m he just he just sat there and
M hm
like that I said get off that fence
And he just he took no diving notice and they all were giggling at me
See so I went out I said get off my property you're trespassing
I said that is my property and when you sit on my fence that is a an of fence
Now I says I'll get the police the next time
Okay
So they just casually got off and walked away
I don't know who he was but he was with
Mm
I'm frightened to leave home
You had trouble as well have you
Well Jim had just put something through Bob's letter box

And he said well just get yourself home and tell your father that I want it paid for this time because I only replaced that glass last week which he had
Yeah
M hm
he'd put it in at the beginning of the week before
So he came in and he he he said I'm just going down to see 's father he's just smashed the glass in the cold frame and I'm I'm sick of this
Cos he's already stopped him setting fire to trees in the orchard over there
Oh yeah

So he went down and it was Kelly he spoke to and er she said he

The only thing you could do is get the you know that kind of plastic edging you can get for wall til es
Yeah
with curved put a bit of that in
That
Yeah
would take the raw the raw edge off
Aha

You can get them in the square ones the six by six but I wa I wanted the way we worked it out eight by four would work out more economic al
Aha
Cos eventually I wouldn't mind the kitchen having quarry qu a quarry til es

Yes
It's the biggest er m fraud er o well civil service outside London

Right
There was er m what I thought was a a white Rolls parked outside our house when I was putting the washing on the line just after you went to work
Er m well I've gotta wash the dishes
I was with and it was I could see it at the front
Oh
Er it turned out it wasn't a Rolls it was a Bent ley but I don't know one car from
Oh yeah
another
A
It's still a rather classy car
Yes
Well it looked like a wedding car cos there were bouquet s in the back
M hm
And Paul was working on his car out the front and I went to ask him if he knew who was getting married
And er he said it had been standing there for quite a while
He thought it was maybe just er the driver had taken someone to the church was waiting to go back for them
And er Betty called me in for a cup of coffee but and I was there I think for over two hours
Tt
I didn't mean to stay that long cos I had a lot to do
Anyway it was it was still there
Like what
it was still there when I took
What do you mean you had a lot to do
Like what
House work
Why
It was still there when I took Jackie's parcel to her and it wa I I think I didn't look out the the window till about five o'clock and it had gone then
But Betty
Well 's a taxi driver
Yes
And t ho er m Betty thinks the er the for do er cars as well
Mm
Yes
See if it is hot enough
Thank you

Right
Is it raining
I suppose it is
I don't know if it is
Well the back wall looks wet
Well th there was no rain on it when I came came here
Must have su must have suddenly started
It is raining
I got the washing nearly all dry anyway
All the shirts
I didn't it was so bright and windy so I put another lot in after that lot came out it'll be only be T - s h i r t s I'll have in the dryer when they finish off
Well these poor b lighter s who got flooded who could do with the wind to dry the houses out couldn't they
Yeah
The er
The what
I delivered those leaf lets this morning in Auburn Place the house at the end
Which one
the one that was flooded the one that was
The one facing on to the bridge
Yes
That er Tes s bought and they did it all up
When they told me at work she'd bought that I was cos they lived up at Green Lane I thought my God he'd have they've picked a a bad spot there cos there's no flood protection at all there
And in fact when the river rises they it drops down on to that house and the house next door
Anyway I saw that everything was up the doors the back door was open the front door was open there was everything up from downstairs and must be awful
Well I saw the curtains were down er m when I took the trip lets
all around there yesterday the curtains were down and it looked as if there was a table piled up with cardboard boxes in the in the front window
There was
Well there's it was er there was a table
And a house further along in Abbe y View there cos i and it was four houses actually in the
The one on
No
Th the one just past the social club
No not that one
Well that one I wa I I delivered there
But no about three houses on from that they were decorating
Now it looked as if they were newly decorating so whether the water got into there or not but it didn't look as if they were in the process of decorating so I hope it didn't for their sake
Well that one on the cor the first one
Aye
That's the one that appears on television
That was the one that was on television with the water right the way
Yeah
up it
But further on you know er what they call the teacher lives
Brian
They've got er m sort of walls in front of the houses right next to the the bay windows with er m with the slot where they they slot in these steel er m plates
Have they
Yes
Oh yes
About two or three of them they have at that end
I never noticed that
Yep
With er m and they had sand they all had sand bags along there but they had these sort of er walls built up
But I mean th they're decorative walls they've got plants growing in the top and this sort of thing built up to the about the level of the window
M hm
and er then they have the gap for the path and they have a er m a steel plate
Because when I went up I had to climb over the steel plate
Cos they hadn't removed them
M hm
Even though the water was all down
But er m
Have they done
the
that themselves
I think so yes
I think so
Yes cos they're not the same
I mean each each house is different but er there's not all of them have themthere's only two or three had done that
And that was at Brian 's end
The ones
And he he is the very end one isn't he
I dunno if he's er but it's his end I don't know if it's his house I can't remember if it was his house but at that end of the street
Didn't he buy the one that we looked at once
We did look at one there
I can't remember
I don't know
But in any case er m th the end house hasn't got that up it's oh what they call her
Rosie
Rosie
Her house has
And the house next to her on either side those are the three houses that have got that on
I've never seen Ro Rosie for years
I know she's working er m
Well her husband was very ill wasn't he
at the workers ' education what is it called
W E A
Workers ' Education Association
She works she works for that
Does she
Oh
Er m
What doing
Does she lecture like
Yes
I think yes
What subject
I can't remember but there was a whole
Well it can't be in Mo or ford because the only thing that
No it's at Ash ing ton
the only thing they do in Mo or ford is birds
Ornithology
No er m I'm sure it's in a at Ash ing ton
Mm
And
Well I've never seen
it advertised
They do quite a they've got quite a big programme in Go s forth and Newcastle and
I'm not sure
I think
Whit ley Bay I think as well
I think I think I heard Jean say something about er m the writers ' workshops

Pardon
I don't like hot food ever
Oh I know you're like my mother stone cold
I don't like it stone cold I just like it nice cos if it's too hot you can't taste it
Try to get it down me before it burns my tongue
These folks and that with all these spice s and things a you can't taste the food you taste
I know
the spice s
Cos that's what it was all about tas take away the taste of the rotten food that's the whole point of spice s
I know I think it's hilarious
As di r er m saying my ginger wine was too hot
Was too hot
Bloody ridiculous
When she's used to eating red hot cu r r i es
But they don't drink red hot stuff I suppose
I suppose that was the difference
They don't drink red hot stuff they drink only eat red hot stuff and they drink cool things to cool their mouth down after
She drinks tea
Yeah
Well she she used to drink tea when she if I ever well I didn't invite her in for a coffee do well I didn't to begin with did I
Well they drink do they not does she

not drink coffee
No
I invite when we walk back from school er m when she first came to live round there and er I used to walk back from school with her sometimes and say would you like a cup of coffee
Well she didn't know anybody of course and she'd say no thank you
And then after oh after a few weeks she said I'll come in for a cup of tea
So I said okay
So I used to make tea for her
And it got in the end actually if I was if I had to do something that was urgent or I had to go somewhere I used to have to say to her something like you know er m oh I better get on I got a lot to do this morning or I'm go i I've to be shopping and be back in time to cook Jim's dinner or something like that cos he's starting oh I've gotta have his dinner ready at twelve before he goes to work and if I really was pushed otherwise she would have come in every day
Not that I minded her coming in every day just didn't not always that time
Aye
I wonder how they're getting on through there
And also if she came in when I had the trip lets it meant that er m you know she was sitting talking to me when I wanted to be playing with them and taking them out and getting on with doing things with them
They still haven't sold the house have they
No
Well I was just talking about that today to Betty
You ar di didn't you see it
Didn't you show someone round it once
Yeah I've shown two lots of people round
Did you notice the bathroom ceiling
Yes
I only saw it er m you showed two lots round didn't you
Mm mm
I did
I only showed er Gillian
I didn't show them right u opened the house and was stood with them walked round with her like you know but breezed
Well actually the time I went in it was er m when Gillian was thinking of buying it
Oh aye
and er I went her mother and father were with her and I just really went in up and down the stairs and they went upstairs and they they shouted oh Ann
Come and look at this
And er in the back I think it was the back bedroom there was a a light switch and the wiring was sort of hanging from from the switch
It looked dangerous
Mm
And there was there was something weird
It wasn't a telephone point I don't know what it was
Television point
No it came from half way along the hall up under the sta i r carpet and into the er m front bedroom but it it didn't have a a sort of you know the
Yes
Aye
it didn't have a telephone sort of attachment
And the bathroom ceiling was black mould
And of course if it if it had been I know they came once because
Who came
WellS y re j
Oh
dropped As di r off and she drove away and I saw her and the four children go along to the house
Mm
cos I was in here and er I think she had some paint in her hand
Oh
and after about ten minutes I thought what the devil is she doing in there
No she only had the three children er m As than a wasn't born
That was it
Yeah
I thought what's she doing in there
Tha that's right she was pregnant wasn't she after
Can't be
As than a wasn't born when she left here
That's right she was
Mm mm
Well surely she was born when
No go well perhaps it wasn't long after As than a was born
Anyway it was it was in the winter
Er m
Is it two years now
Oh I can't remember
It is you know
I think As th
Eighteen months old
Two Christmases
No Jan u ar
Jan u
It's two Christmases anyway
it's January the seventh
Ast hana's birthday she must be two
Nonono no she's the
Oh
They moved before Christmas
I know it's two Christmases
Aye
Well whatever
And er well that might have been it A As than a might have been a tiny baby
So I went along there cos I thought if she was painting the children will be frozen and nothing to sit on and no
Mm mm
heating
So I went down and she was she was painting the bathroom ceiling
And I said er I'll take the children back to my house with meat least they'll be warm I can give them a drink or something
So they came back but of course if it's jus if it's been pouring in on that bathroom ceiling again it's it when I took when Elsie called up to me come and look at this the bathroom ceiling was black mould
It wasn't black when I showed those people round but it was damp
You could see
Oh no
the stains of the damp
Perhaps he's been and washed it off again
Sometimes when he comes
Yeah
through
Aye
But nobody how long is it since the last time we showed them in
It's quite a while now
I dunno
I can't remember when it was
And the key's still on our kitchen windows ill so
Yes
Yeah but look at the amount of houses that are for sale
Oh yesbut but look how quickly Marie sold hers
But it was in a better state
Better condition wasn't it
Oh it was beautiful
I know
Aye
But I mean there's a lot of houses for sale
Some of them are sold quite quickly
There's some new people in number ten is it
I don't know
They park their car just beside Doug's house
I don't see them very much they tend to use the back door and sort of come out and then go down
Mm
the back lane
I don't see them come round the front
You haven't drunk your coffee
Did you see your mother
Yes
And she's complaining about not going anywhere or
Ee
The places she's been in the last couple
of weeks
Yes
She's
If she could only remember where she'd been and how much she's enjoying it while she's actually doing it
Aye
Cost me a fiver for her hair to be done on Monday and another fiver to go out on Berlin Square on Tuesday
And tomorrow she's going to this thing at the chapel
Going for tea
What thing at the chapel
Going for tea and then for the service afterwards
Mm
Oh yes
So they're going about four o'clock
I'll have to go earlier to see her because they'll be maybe getting her changed for that
Aha
Karen came and asked me I says alright
Have you got to go
And I said yes
Mind she didn't go out this afternoon cos they went some of them went up to the British Legion Club this afternoon
Didn't she want to go
Or wasn't there room
I don't know
She were up sick all night but I don't think she she would have wanted to go anyway
The er m you know the rather large lady that who I always speak to
Er yes
In the last bed there
Yes
Er she'd been up there sometimes
She's really enjoyed herself because tip ple
What had she been drinking
She likes her wh i skies
Oh
A couple of wh i skies
Yeah she said it was really
Well your mother wouldn't want that
I know
And it was she who told me that she'd been that's where they'd been
And she remembers everything
I know
Aye
Your mother doesn't remember where she's been as soon as she's gets out of the mini bus
Yes I know
Tt
I mean and she and
Well I was just thinking
she asks the same question over and over again
looking at those well it was Denise who brought the list in but I'd already with the sta er the gardens but you know the garden scheme in North umber land
It's lying around somewhere
Aye
And I thought you might want to go some time anyway er not on a Sunday
But there's one at B lag den Hall
Has she got her colostomy bag back on yet
Or are they still leaving it off
I don't know
How do they take her anywhere if she's got the bag off
Must well that's you out
Well I was thinking we could perhaps take her to B lag den Hall now that's open
Well supposing you if that's okay
I mean
Anyway they're having it's
it's one thing being in a hospital but to take her somewhere
it depends it depends on the weather
enclosed is
It depends on the weather of course
not very fair to her
So that I mean that's I'm a half day that day
I think I read that B lag den was open from half past
It's open from
one till half past three or something
Well that's no it's been
Or was it half past one where did I put it
Was it half past one to dusk
It's just there
That's it there
It's not much
It's later
It's my half day on the that Sunday
Where is it
I don't know where it is I haven't marked
Well you've got so many piles of papers lying around
They're not mine there those are all yours
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Where
I've got my glasses on I'll do it I'll read it
You can't see without your glasses
I can't
There B lag dent here
It's at the top
Where
I've marked it at the top
Some time
Oh yeah
in May
May the what was it
You ca you can't see it
I can't see at oh right
Well I can see there alright
Wait a minute till I switch on the other light
I'll tell you it's
It's cos it's written on blue paper in tiny print
it's the third of May
Da f fo dil s and arbor et um
And there's a coffee bar
products plant and cake stalls
Suitable for wheel chairs
Well that's what I was thinking
Toilet for disabled
Yeah
Tea with home - b a k e d s cones and cakes
Open from one till five
M hm
It still isn't a lot of time if you finish work at quarter past three and you're not home till
I'm I'm a half day I finish at twelve
Oh
Oh
Right
Oh that's okay then
I was just thinking if we take her out that afternoon
Sunday May the third
In fact I was there's a I'm going to suggest that we we take some of the patients er and early about when is this
It's in June
Well do you want to go take some of the other patients that day and I'll go as an escort
Well on the twelfth of June my Age Concern are having era fair at B lag den Hall all day that day
On when
The twelfth of July
So on Hazel 's birthday
No that's twelfth of June
Twelfth of June your Hazel 's birthday
What's the twelfth of July
I've no idea
It's the twelfth of July is last year the er
Fourth of July's Independence Day
it's the twelfth of July of last year they had one
No that's the fourteenth of July
I don't think anything's the twelfth of July
No
It's the fourteenth of July is Bastille Day
But anyway
And what are you that day
I'm on early
All ear lies
Ordinary early
Quarter past three early
Ohwell I say I'm on early but I will be I could be an early or a late
So that's
So if you took them that day you'd be going while you were on duty
Well for pa most of it or part of it
But I could organize that
And if what they call it
Is that a Sunday at Easter
It's a Sunday
If they can actually let me know whether that bus is available or not
You're not gonna drive that bus are you
I didn't say I was
But Mr has got a P S V licence
I don't know if I can drive
Oh
the bus or not it depends we'll have to see
And does he does he drive the buses
Er the hospital bus like
No
that
No
No
He's never driven
He's not down as a as a driver for the mini bus now
But he's got a P S V licence which is a different thing altogether
Yesbut if he was willing to drive in his spare ta time he would have his name down surely
Wouldn't he
Well one would have thought so but I said to er Mrs you see about the mini bus no not the mini bus the M S bus being available and I said the problem was or maybe that we'd have to have drivers who have had a P S V licence or what they call it
It isn't a P S V license now it's very different type of licence
Well whatever it's called
But it's the same thing
Yeah
And she said oh my husband's just renewed his
So he could drive and so there'd be no problem she says
But he's never ever as far as I know offered to drive the mini bus
Does he work
Well
It sounds it sounds odd saying oh my husband's just renewed his it makes it sound as if he hasn't had a P S V er m licence for a while
I don't know
Cos if he was working and driving he wo it surely he would have automatically renewed it
I don't know
So it sounds as if he's just renewed it after a while
They used to have some sort of test on that
So maybe that's why he's never volunteered before
If he didn't have the licence he couldn't
Well yes of course
Except he could have for the mini bus of course
Where's my knit ting gone
I think he had a pet shop
Well he wouldn't need a P S V licence for a pet shop
But I don't know that he does now
Unless you were a Pet Shop Boy and were a roadie
Mm mm
I can't remember what line I was doing
Well because she periodic ally brings the bird seed for the the bird on the ward
I'm sure he never
Whether the business was successful or not
I had a vague recollection somebody said he had this pet shop at B lag den or som not B lag den er
B lag den
There are no shops
not B lag den
at B lag den
Bury
Oh
M hm
But we could still take the mini bus and just take three or four
Yeah
Well that's an alternative
But that will be a good day to go out on
Mm mm
But we could take my mother on the other one
Yeah
Or we could take them periodic ally
Could go out well the next then there's a queue a mile long
I said no
I said mark the ones on that thing
you want to go to
That's when I
It's a bit far to take her to near Ber wick
I wasn't thinking of taking her there I was thinking of taking you
Oh
Anyway it might be too cold
And Corn Hill on the Tweed 's a bit far for you my love
I was thinking about
There's An wick
cos you
Ho wick at An wick
I was thinking of you going there
Where's Hall ing ton
I dunno
It tells you
Does it not
Oh
Wait a minute
Between Col well and Kirk har l
Mm
Et au l Manor 's open nearly every Sunday
Wasn't it Kirk oh no it was Kat heat on
Was it Ka
Where Capability Brown
Yeah
came from
Yes
That's right
We never did find his house did we
No
If there's any
And there's nothing there
if there's any remnants of his house
There was certainly no indication of it anywhere in the village
There wasn't even anybody to ask
Nope
But if you wanted to go to any of those those I marked for my days off apart from the one to B lag den on a half day
But I could go that day
Cos it's no distance to B lag den
The others we'll take
We could walk there
Tt
Aye it's three mi it's over four miles it's I haven't got the street map it's about four miles
Well we took your mother and we that time
Yeah
Perhaps we'll get the bus there
And then in those days there was a bus service that way
I don't think there's a bus service running that way now
Isn't there
Nope
To get to
Well how many houses are on that road
There's only
Well there's a fair number
Actually on the road itself there's well there is a fair number
There's quite a few in the estate itself
Quite a few houses down
Yeah
the estate
Tt
Did you tell me what did they call the one who lived there
That worked with you
Near the road there
Yeah
Di
She got
Oh that's right
Where is she
Well er she's at home or she's in the er m R E I
I used to see her in the hairdresser s sometimes
while the death is being investigated
And she she went into the R E I with a query stroke
I know
I remember that
A query I think she had a query lump on her breast or something er lump or something
And they transferred her to the the Cottage and she did quite well and she was home
And whatever lump it was they said wasn't anything to worry about
But then it was virtually er clear again she was saying but she has a brain tum our
And whether they can operate
Mm
Oh dear
She was nice she was a nice woman
But he retired early of course because of his bad knees
M hm
He couldn't well he was the head game keeper for Lord
Yeah
And er the damp ness and the tramping all over the rough ground and what have you wasn't good for his knees
Mm
He came from all over Mac aw or somewhere down there he came from
Mm
Didn't know that
And when he came out of the army you know after the war er he didn't want to go
Well I think I don't know if they went back to the pits and sort of left but he didn't want to stay there and and got this job as a game keeper
He had a stroke
They say that if you if it wasn't for the shooting we wouldn't have any grouse or pheasant s cos they wouldn't be preserved
they they'd be on a farm if he wants
The grouse apparently it would
I nearly stood on a grouse once when we were walking up I wasn't walking with you it was when we were with the Footpath Society
Got the shock of my life
I was walking along talking to Mi ka I think and it just shot up from in front of me I had my foot out
It waited till the very last second
Mm
Well that's
I couldn't believe it
Perhaps it decided to stay put and I wouldn't notice it was there and maybe at the last second it decided it would run for it
Well we nearly when I was up with the children at the to when I was
Mm
and it went up into those they were coming down in the mini bus and er we stopped so the I can't remember where we stopped
Anyway it was a good job we did because these er m these grouse and these chickens I mean they were so blended in with the the the roadside you could hardly see them and then they moved
As we were coming down so slowly and I think we stopped suddenly cos then they walked across the path
You couldn't you co you couldn't see them when they were on the roadside you know on on the whe when they moved
Mm
on to the actual track like so
Mm
And Joy got the red squirrel so at er when I was out
Well Edith told me that er m
Or was it Kenneth saying
as soon as she bought her house do you know which is her house
Yes I've been to it
What did you go there for
To deliver something for you
Oh maybe a Christmas
Can't remember what it was
card it would be
Cos that the you know the le
But that's not where we saw the red squirrel
you know at the left hand side of her house they've planted some trees
That's out the back there
Yeah
But there was already no
It's at the oh
It's out the back
No the back of her house opens has er m
Goes out on to the s pri the spring head itself
The back of her house the back garden er m faces on to a field
There's the fence
Mm
o over the fence from that er the back garden is the field but
That leads over to the
other side of the house
but to the left of their house when you're facing the front door to the left
Whe you mean when you're outside
the there are some trees
or inside
Outside
There are some er m trees there
M hm
there was already quite a few trees there it was like a small wood and they've plan and
Well it is that is
they've planted some extra ones
I think they've planted some
That's the spring
fruit trees
It's a huge garden
So they've got a
But we were
wood in it
I know but up there
but from the time they moved in she noticed red squirrels
Oh we didn't walk that way we went up further down
And er m
I think she said she'd seen a badger as well
Well it's quite possible yeah
In the from there on wards you know we there's nothing
No
You know a after those houses
Yes I mean that's right
th er the there's fields until you get to the Irish Sea int there
Just about
Well yes
But there's a few odd houses a few odd villages which are only small but there's nothing much really
When you re walk going west it's countryside all the way
M hm
Well
She's gone to California Edith
Has she
I met her er m
On holiday
Yes
I don't know if she's gone alone or with some or with a friend but er she said she wanted to she'd never been to California and she wanted to go before she was too old and crotchety to get there because David's he's in no fit state to go anywhere any more
So why what
So she asked she asked if sh her sister - i n - l a w cos Sheila's living er near her daughter
And did er
Well so
Near Ber wick or something

No
Well is that the way to have the chair
No I'll tell you how far the rain affected us personally you know the well the antique shop at the end of our road
Yeah
you know there are steps go up it
aha
behind it
yeah
well they go up at the side of it and down behind it
Down to the river
down and there's a path goes along and it comes it goes under the road bridge and it comes out at the foot bridge and it runs next to it
Aha
the water got up to the second step from the top but when instead of turning right into my road if you'd keep straight on
aha
and go along the river you know where the flood wall is
yeah
Mm
that's called Bennett s Walk Bennett s Walk was all flooded that was closed off
mm
but that wasn't with flood water coming over that was because it was coming up the drains cos it couldn't drain into the river
a haha
so those houses were all sandbagged but it it got into some the problem was that the the road closed sign kept blowing down in the wind I tried to stand it up but it was oh so heavy I got it up but it it immediately blew down again and
Well we went down
people couldn't see that it was water there
Oh
sort of going just a short way along and having to reverse back out again
I tell you how bad our one was it was all over the road this the the river line
mm
at
from the
goes up
some er when one of the
where the court is where you used to play tennis
when the father of one of the children came
it was right
he said has flooded
oh
yeah
and there's a house there I think it's a farm on the corner and they they always get it I mean
When was this
Last week with the rains
T hur er Wednesday and Thursday the children I have before and after school at Goose Hill School you know the one the one near me just the bottom of the road on the corner that's had to be closed on Thursday because the boiler room had flooded on Wednesday and er they had to dry it out and also the children from New min s ter were told anyone living in the Middle Queens are a go home
And they closed that er school did they not
I thought they sent them home cos the rains in
They must send them home at er m they must of sent them home about quarter to three because they got home at quarter past
I remember somebody came in at the shop and says the New min s ter School had been sent home but where which school's that
Is that the one round down the bottom of your lane
No New min s ter is the one along Mid ford road the one in the same grounds at Chant ry
Oh
if you were going
Chant ry school
Yes
Oh that's right up behind me
Yes well theytheythey thought it
oh I
yeah the the the er m they share the same school gate
Aye
you go up along drive in and New min s ter is on your left and Chant ry is on your right at but I should imagine er m I should imagine that quite a lot of Chant ry School children would be sent home because they're for the children outside of M or pet h you know they go there from
yeah
and er where else
Mid ford
Do they go there from Nether With am
Yes they'll go there from Mid ford and of course the water was well well up
yeah
into the gardens the back gardens of the houses in Mid ford Road
Ooh it was a sight
and the greenhouses
the trees were racing down the river the river was running oh they were huge then of course when it sub sides you've got a build up of trees that's left you know left on the where they've blocked
There's a big tree was wedged on er I don't know if it's still there on Friday I took a trip up to see it
See if there's bodies if there's any bodies down there they'll be lifting
Oh heck er m under the er
She said heck she's got a swear box in our house

Is that the one from the Join er s
No the one from the Join er s that footbridge
Cos we walked other day
that was closed off on er
there was one in the paper there was a picture of it in the paperand it I'm sure it did say the old gate bridge I'm sure and it was nearly ow t it was going over the bridge
you know where the clock you know where the clock tower is
Go past the clock tower
mm
and that's the old gate bridge that nice big stone one the newest one
you go over the clubs on the other side we used to go up
you go over to the club
the bank there where you used to
that's right
that's the one that's was right over the top of that
Yes
Yeah you know in those house
and it was it was over the footbridge you know when you go into M or pet h instead of turning
Yeah
right to go into go into Goose Hill
oh yeah aha
to come to my house when you go over that bridge there's one further over on the left just a footbridge from the Join er s
yeah
through to Chant ry Place
mmmm
that bridge was closed off it was up to there
bridge from the Join er s
Yes that was closed off
That might of been the one that was
I don't know if the I didn't see the water over it because we went Jim and I went out at about er m ten o'clock

Would you mind having the boys for about half an hour because I would like to get B ry on y 's hair cut

Where're you taking her
Probably to the one at Staff hill if I could have an if I can get an appointment booked
Yeah
It's just that well you can imagine what she's gonna be like
But she screams so much when she gets her hair cut and she won't have
I know
it tied back
So even though I'd like
I still haven't given that's reminded me seeing Sh on a there I I don't think I've given her that pair of trousers and the sweatshirt and I told her that I've got them

The children have been difficult this weekend I don't know what's a matter with them I think they're just
Well the er th they seem to Richard seemed to cry a bit more or a bit easier you know if he bumped himself and B ry on y and I think it was well B ry on y it seemed to be a heavy cold that was making her feel miserable
Yes
And I think maybe it was with all of them
They were just slightly under the weather
And Martin has taught them to say you stupid zombie
Oh great
Oh great
I know that's I'm really pleased about that
Oh dear
So James is going around calling everybody a stupid zombie
Oh well it makes a change from a stupid idiot

It's gonna be wonderful at nursery if he goes straight up to his teacher again
Oh
Oh heck
Again

You know when she told him to close the cupboard
No
At nursery
No
She was he was going in her cupboard Mrs I gather he said you stupid idiot to her
Oh dear
Oh what a start on your first visit

I think that's part of the reason why she said you've got your hands full
I heard her say you've got your hands full but I didn't know why
Oh hey
And then with Richard having the screaming fits when it was time to go home
Ah but that that
Very reluctant

He was screaming because he had to go home

That one okay right oh

Oh right
Oh might as well go and sit down then Ann waiting for blast off
Ooh
It is chilly honestly and I don't want to put the heating on again
I I'll hold it off for the I'm ec ono miz ing on the
Doesn't sound very hopeful
Does er m Bob er m know a lot about growing plants and things as well as vegetables
Oh yeshe he
I'm looking I want somebody who knows something about gardening
I'm trying to find out why one of our azaleas has turned up its toes
Albert over the road will be the best one to
Oh
tell you that cos he was er me rm school
Oh
grounds gardener
He
I'll try
he would deal with shrubs more than Bob hasn't got a I mean he grows flowers and
I know
and things like that
yeah
Thank you
Er m but er mI mean he nearly does know but I mean Albert is
Is it lit
Mm mm Albert is the ga rd he you know really good gardener
Er I mean he shows
Well they're both in tub s they're both planted in erica ceo us compost which is what we were told
Yeah
When we fed them before the winter we gave them proper er fer til iz er for things that need acid soil
Mm mm
I know they can be affected by wind and frost and it turns the leaves brown and kills off the buds but why is only one affected
And as soon as it's
Are they different kinds
Or
No
are they exactly the same
They're the same kind exactly but they're different colours that's all
They're both in they're both in wooden half barrels
But but don't azaleas don't azaleas shed their leaves
Er m I think some do but some are ever green and these are ever green
Oh
Because I had one in the garden here and we moved it actually when we we took the er hedge out er to put the fence and the gate on er and we moved it somewhere else and it er it just died off
Er but it used to er shed its leaves
Well yeah I think some do
And I think you're supposed to prune a little bit aren't you
They're not big enough to prune yet
They'rethey're about er
But should you not prune them lightly to
eighteen inches
encourage new growth you see
No i it's er
Albert going past he's back and for wards to the garden
It said in the gardening book
It didn't say much about them
Really it's about you know huge er m r ho do den dr on s it's only a little bit at the end of that
But er m
I've got a book here
you know that er poly the ne that's got wire net ting in between it like a like a wire net ting sandwich with po with clear poly the ne on the outside
We bent some of that round the wind ward side of the barrel
Oh right yes a sort of
and I and tied a lump of string round it to keep it on
So it's been sheltered from the wind
Ooh unless the
We've made sure
cat's done something on it
Oh God next door's cats
Er I thought I had one in the house yesterday I went as Sheila was going er m Jackie was in her garden
Oh yes
and I was telling her that that was the daughter - i n - l a w of Mrs who lived there before
Owned the house originally
Graham did
Yes
and er I'd left the front door and the inner door open and
It don't switch off I'll have to go and do it
oh and er the cat was lurking around however it had gone somewhere else
I can't
Oh gosh
I've done it full
Oh never mind I'll drink half of it
Yeah azaleas
It's a weak one anyway Ann
It just says where is it
Lime - f r e e soil plus large quantities of pe at or leaf mould
Some shade during the heat of the day
Er it doesn't get any
Er m when the sun's at the hottest anyway it's sheltered it only gets oh and the other thing is you er it it doesn't say here but you're supposed to it's supposed to be somewhere where they'll be sheltered from the early morning sun if there's been
Oh
a frost
Oh we've had frost we haven't any early morning sun anyway
Thank you
They said your azaleas reach five to eight feet
it doesn't say does it
I gave it some water cos I
They might be different types you see
One might
Yeah but
you see what I mean
I know it's it's just turning up its toes
Oh
Dear dear
How much are car mat s Paul
I think they're within the region of two quid each up to about five pound each
Mm I can afford that
Ever green Azaleas
Mostly small plants three to four feet high
Is that what you've got
Yes they are small cos I got them
Small dark green leaves
to go in these half barrels
flowering pro l if i call y May and June
Mostly hybrid s
Forms of a z ale a
Look for the hybrid flowering June July
Exceptionally hardy but needing shade
Well it's against the garage wall
Mostly very hardy large flowers pink no pruning needed
Propagate d by layers
It said in my book just tidy them up if you you know if they needed a bit of tidying up
planting out
No it doesn't say any more than that
No it doesn't say
That's more or less what it said in my book except er m they need to be shaded from early morning sun if there's been a frost
Well we've had plenty of frost s but there's been no early morning sun
I know there's been wind
Oh there's been a lot of wind
but er
which probably is bad as a frost
Yeah
Have you got them in separate containers
Yes
Ah yes I think you told me
And the they're beside the garage facing towards the kitchen
Mm oh they're sheltered
and the sun always comes along the side of the house
I can tell because me me washing always blows towards the gate to the back gate
Mm mm
right
Mm mm
Er m so that must be that's south over there isn't it
Mm mm
Well it should be a south wind it's not even a north wind
That's west that's south
Yes that's right
No
Hang on
That's west that's east that's north
Wait a minute wh which which direction's S cot oh me nose
that's south that's south that's south
Yes
that's south
Well it's coming along the side of the house along there
Yeahbut that'll be like a tunnel you know when the wind's blowing because the wind hits our front
Yeah
windows and is it the one er nearest the front that is
Yes
Oh yeah no
But it's only about er what's in between the two barrels
Th the th you know that er m small cauldron with er prim roses in
Mm
That's all that's separating them I mean they're close together
Yesbut different plants respond differently to
and it's not big enough to shelter the other one and the other one looks perfectly healthy
Mm unless you've just got some disease
Good cup of coffee that
Eh
I said it's a good cup of coffee that
Oh
Thank Paul
Thank you Paul
It's the one coffee I get made per day
I get one in the morning and then at night
Well he makes tea at night
He makes a cup of tea at night and that's his effort
So er Sheila was saying that er m Andre a's in Lon er Bath
Oh
Er m I said what's she doing she says she's gonna do archaeology
Oh yes now
But she said she's only she said she's twenty one and she said
I think Edith
she's got no A levels yet
Well what about er m Kat h lee n' s Jenny is seventeen
I know I know and she's coming to Newcastle
Yes
er m University
Yeah
cos she said she'd just bought a flat
M hm
she's gonna lend to them
Er m but I mean I thought Andre a was going in catering and she says well that's what we hope
We thought that would be best for her
Oh yes she was very keen wasn't she when she used to come and stay with her Grandma
But she says she's now wanting to do archaeology er m but she says she hasn't got any A levels
You can't do that without A levels
So she says I don't think she's really capable of getting any
So she's just left
Yes
Andre a
Yeah oh
So she says Graham er m forgot the name what do they call him
And Jennifer's doing er did she say history and politics
Oh right is she doing history and poli oh
Aha yeah
Er m Gill am he's working for some er publisher s in London
Mm so he must be twenty
Oh he'll be
four five
Yes I think cos he's through university
Oh and is Ann still in Kenya
I didn't ask her any of it
Yeah she's in Na i rob im hm
Er yes
Na i rob i and she says they come across she comes across occasionally
They were gonna let the house
Well I thought Edith said she came across at Christmas cos if you remember we've always sent her Christmas cards to her house in near Har ro gate haven't we
That's right yes yes
Well we didn't know where else to send them
No
Cos she said
But I'm sure
she'd gone for a couple of days when she was up but she says she hasn't been up to see her for about eighteen months
You know when er the fir when we went up to Edith 's when she'd first moved in for
Yeah
coffee
Mm
Didn't Edith say then that Ann came across for Christmas
To be with the children mm
Well that's two years ago
Isn't it
Oh yes it will be
It it wasn't last well it'll be nearly two years
No she's be er m Edith moved in was it January or February
January
That's right because we got a card in the in our Christmas card saying that they were moving back to
That's right
Right
and er they hope to be in by January the something
I knew it was January
Yeah oh cos that's when she said Frank Frank only came for a short while or something
Yes
So he doesn't have to pay taxes
I mean they must find they must find it expensive because I mean if they're keeping that house on they have to have somebody going in to look at it won't they
And they'll have a home in Na i rob i
Yes
Still it must pay them must pay them to do that
Oh what's Paul doing
Perfectly honest I don't know he spends a lot of time in there
Oh I wa I was wa
I don't quite know what he does sometimes
I was watching for him er m I'd been to the lo o and I glanced out the er landing window and I thought it looked too tall for you
I thought it was his shape moving behind your kitchen net curtain and er I thought oh I'll dash and ask him now about those car mat s so I can go and get them
Well I tell him what kind of car it is
Yes
Er m
Well this is this is why I thought perhaps er m I didn't want to ask Jim too much or he would know I was buying them for him you see
That's right yes
And I remember this time in Winners when he he picked them up and looked at them and said I don't think these are the right ones for my car and that that's why I thought
They were too small you see weren't they
and I was thinking where on earth is there a shop in that sells sells things like that or do you have to go to a garage and I'd forgotten that that fruit
Yes
shop was one now
Yes it's it's very useful actually
I've been up there buying things for him in the past when he was er operating the taxi and he hadn't time to go himself
Yeah
And er if they haven't got it they'll get it for you
They're very good
Mm
Yeah
You mean if they haven't got any I'll have to make a model
I bought him one Christmas years and oh hey we were just married and I ordered him an extending ladder from the Co - o p
Mm
and I ordered it in November it finally came in February
So I bought
him something else for Christmas something smaller and I made him a model out of match sticks and I said this is the prototype
Oh my
of your Christmas present
I
goodness
That would need some concentration
I I just sort of made er m two short ladders about two inches long
Oh right
I think I did it with a pair of tweezers to so I could stick the
match sticks together and then I stuck one half on top of the other to make it look like an extending ladder
Yes
When is his birthday then
Er Wednesday
Oh right right
So he's er an April er m birthday
Yes
Mm
He's always telling me all the best people are born in April
Well my my vary
Jennifer she was born on April Fool's Day
I think that must
Oh yes
be awful being an April Fool
I'll tell you who else is the first of April as well
Mrs at this end of the old people's bungalow s
Oh yes
I know who you mean
I see he er the son's re er well he hasn't retired he's er given notice that he's not er going to be on the market committee now
Oh I saw your photograph in the
Oh
Did you see it
I'll tell you why he's probably not going to be on the mar market committee because his daughter had a
Yes he said
jewellery stall
he said there's been a lot of er m talk about his daughter and er m son - i n - l a w having a stall and is one of the markets where he intends to trade in and er m he thinks
This is
that the he'll be sort of for a right
She's on the council the town council his daughter
Is she
Fiona yes
According to Jim she's never opened her mouth and said a single thing yet but er
She turns up
Yes
Well I suppose he's had a lot of flack I mean look at the
Well he says that
everyone says if you want a council house in you've got to
Well that's mentioned in the art was mentioned in the article as well
you've got to join the Liberal Party and you've got to be related to I an
Er m he got a lot of flack
But let's face it
when he was on the housing er m
well all his three children got houses at at eighteen
None
Yes
of them married
Yeah
and when when this one who's got the market stall was pregnant
Mm
she gave up her flat and went to live with her mother
Mm
When she was pregnant again I think the father by then was divorced so she married him she immediately got a house
Yes
no she had a house to start with
When you think of all the families on the waiting list
I know they're waiting
and single eighteen year olds being given
Yeah
houses it's it's they left themselves wide open for
That's right well that was
people to
mentioned in the article as well about the housing committee
Yes
in the er m well silly to put yourself in that predicament wouldn't it
Mm
It's mad
It is
Stupid
I'm going
But remember when
this afternoon
Are you
I've been
Oh yeah
we're having a salad to make
That's what he's doing in the kitchen washing the cos Paul says if you're back late I'll be having my dinner before you come I says okay
I forgot to check wha if Jim's got a meeting tonight
If he has I've got to think of something to cook that he can finish off cooking so he can eat it before I get back from aerobics so I can stick mine in the microwave to warm up
You warm it up
You warm it up
Yes I mean it
m hm
it doesn't need to be absolutely freshly cooked
Yes
No this is why I ca I don't know if you remember but er m she was interviewed by a reporter Fiona and she i when the market traders were all on strike and you know all those months the
er and there was only the two fruit stalls there
Yeah
and occasionally the fish s t well
Yes
yes occasionally three fruit stalls and one fish stall she said er the market the market hadn't ceased trading trading it was perfectly healthy it was doing very well
Cos I thought I
thought where have you been
I mean there had been how many
Ninety was it
Yes
Sometimes a hundred
Mm mm
And er four stalls at the most there and according to her it was perfectly healthy and there was nothing wrong with it
I thought and then I happened to go Jim came to carry the fruit and vegetables for me and when it had opened again and there was she with this I looked at Jim and I said ah
That's why she said that she's got this jewellery stall
Oh
I didn't know what stall type of stall she had I just read about it in the paper
I haven't had a proper look around the market for I looked
I went down
I looked at the buttons next to the fruit stall because what I usually do I go and get the fruit and vegetables if Jim's on the right shift he takes them home otherwise I buy them while it's quieter the man keeps them for me I go straight across the leisure centre to soft clay cos it's only open on Wednesdays and then on the way back one of them walks
Oh you put them in the pr am
and I put the fruit and vegetables in the buggy and we come straight home cos it's time to eat by then
Mm mm
I'll have another cigarette and then I must dash
Yes I'm going to the street and getting an early lunch and getting myself organized for going out
What time are you to go up
Well half past two I usually er m
Dorothy was telling me this morning you know when we were at er m nursery
Mm mm
That's lit er m I heard Mrs you've got your hands full there
Dorothy told me why
She'd er Mrs had asked James to close the cupboard and he called her a stupid idiot
Mm
Yes
Oh that's gone out
Oh my
And now Martin's taught him to call people stupid zombie so Dorothy's not pleased
Oh dear
He's not going to be very popular with her help at
Oh he'll soon get out of it
I mean they they settle down they settle down
Yes
I mean it's good for them learning to be amongst a lot of children and they soon learn that er m they can't have their way
Well her boys are quite amenable really but er m
B ry on y is the one
B ry on y you know
Mm
the tantrum screaming carries on when she doesn't want her coat on to go out
Yeah
I had a bit
I mean
of that with Joshua last
if she
week and he's got to the stage now where don't want to
Yes
and he starts crying if you insist er m and you have to be pretty firm with him
Mm mm
and won't say anything er go away go away
Yeah B ry on y went if you well she's not so bad now she's got over that phase where she refused to have her coat on but if you're trying to get her ready er m and she doesn't want to get ready she'll say either go away or don't do that to me if I'm trying to get her coat on
Oh dear
The joys
And and James sometimes says I don't want to hear that
Well she says it's not her and I don't remember saying that
Oh
Oh well it must be you then
I mean no if he says something that I don't like I usually say oh that's not very nice is it
Mm
But if er if I'm s if I say to him you're not you're not eating properly sit up and you know p u bring your plate near to you
Mm mm
I don't want to hear that
Tt oh
Well won't be long now before they're in school another another year
A year this summer
Er m they'll go a year in wait a minute
They'll go a year come September won't it
Yes
April May June July August September they'll be four in five months
Mm mm
by then
Gosh it soon passes doesn't it
When you think it doesn't seem five minutes ago
Ee I know
It seems when you first had
that the tiniest
them it it seemed ages before they were going to be on their
Well they was
going to school
well James especially the the tiniest Baby - g r o
Yes
his feet came down to the knees on it
Yes
and they had B ry on y in I'm sure it was a doll's dress
Mm mm
you know when they were two days old Trevor took me through to the hospital
He's not working
Who
Er m Shirley 's husband Jimmy
That's funny
Cos I've seen him about a lot
Jim said that to me yesterday and I said isn't he on holiday
Well he seems
That that
to be having a long holiday
Jim said to me last night is er Jimmy h is he not working
No
I've just seen him go past
I thought I wonder if you knew cos he's been about a lot lately
I haven't noticed
Mm yes he's been
Oh
going out with the dog rather than Shirley
Oh
I wonder if er m Shirley 's sister's working because she often meets her nieces yes her nieces from school and she has her nephew with her you know Judith's
Oh
Do does her sister live here now
No I
Cos didn't she leave her husband
Oh she remarried
She's
Oh has she remarried has she
she's got yes have you seen her
No I haven't
eldest daughter
I don't know
Ruth you know the one I used to look after
Well when she first left her husband she moved in with Shirley
With Shirley yes
and er how did they all fit in that house
I don't know
Cos there was Shirley and Jimmy and Ann and Sarah and Jud it hand Ruth and Christopher and Christopher was was Christopher nine
Or was he at road by then
Er m Ruth was definitely at Goose hill School
She's very tall very slim and very very attractive
She's really pretty
Mm I don't know
And Christ Christopher 's six foot something and a very handsome young man
And does her sister work
Well this is what I was wondering because
Mm
because Shirley seems to have been looking after anyway she married this Robert
Mm
apparently she used to go out with him before she married Derek I think her first husband was called
And now she's got er Rona and Sophie I can't remember the boy's name
So she's got six children altogether
She had three to her first marriage
I can't no she's got Ruth and Christopher Judith's the mother
Oh
Oh right
She's got Ruth a Shirley 's Ann to me looks more like Jud ith than she looks like her mother
Oh right
Yes
Except of course Ann's blonde and
Yes
er Shirley 's black or it was
She seems to have gone very grey very quickly
Oh
You know really really quickly
Well I I supp o this is her sister you're talking about
Mm mm
No
Shirley herself
Shirley
Oh I hadn't noticed it
Yeah her sister's got slightly lighter hair than than Shirley had
I do I don't know her sister much
But I think they live at Pegs wood
But the other thing is Judith's husband plays in a band now I'd I th it might be a pipe band I'm not sure
Oh
and he travels ar ou they go or is it a band
I don't know er m but he sometimes goes abroad with it I think but he he goes to different parts of the country and Jud ith goes with him
I know er m when there was only Ruth and Christopher before Jud ith had Rona they sometimes used to come and stay with Shirley
I would think it would be easier for Shirley to go to their house to look after them now
I'd have thought so yes yeah
But I think I think
Does does the boy come to this the the girl come to this school
No er m the little ones
Yes
Yes
Oh and they live at Pegs wood do they
Well
I just think they might
I wonder well they did they certainly were living in Pegs wood but I've noticed when they bring the children to school the car frequently comes along the river way
Oh they must live down there somewhere or maybe I mean
So that to come that way
they've gotta be they're coming from the bottom of Bennet 's Walk or from
Or from
Courts street
or from up the hill or somewhere yes
Mm
Or unless they come from S to bb Hill and come by the station and over the crossing
Well that means they've gotta come over the crossing
I know but it's it's sometimes
Gotta be quicker
it's sometimes very difficult to
The traffic
turn into Goose Hill off er m
That's right
off the main road
Right I'd better go and get ready and go and get those car mat s
Well make sure you get the right ones
I know
Ask can these be changed if they're not right
Keep the bill
Yes
Keep the bill
I'll take the jars
I've got some jars there's s bottles and things for the er m
I've got milk bottles that I you know when I bought the odd bottle
I've still oh
and I don't know wh how to get rid of them
I've still got one milk bottle left
Well I've got three because sometimes they they haven't got milk in the Co - o p and they haven't got milk in the in Ice land
Mm
I call at Louie 's and he
Oh
had bottled milk
I didn't know they sold them
Yes
Yes
Er m so I've bought a few bottles and I don't
Well take them take them back
Is there a crate there or what
Take them back there
Oh I never thought
Yes I never thought
That's an idea
I wonder if that has does that milkman still come round here
Has he got any customers left
I don't I think he does I think he comes late at night Paul er said cos sometimes he's up watching videos or whatever
Oh I've heard the milkman
er m
I've heard bottles rattling early in the morning but I sort of one o'clock two o'clock but I hadn't
cos I was sort of lying in bed sort of late
noticed who it was
one night when Paul came up and I wasn't asleep and I saw like this bright light
Mm
and Paul was coming up the stairs I said is that the police is that a police car
And er he said no it'll be the milk it's the milkman he comes at this time
So it must be that one
Mm mm
because the other chap comes about half past eight in the morning nine o'clock

what
the dinosaurs exhibition at the Hancock and the other things there cos it's a good museum then we could have er lunch at MacDonald s and a look round the we could go to the museum as wellthat's free
yes
if I can find my way there
I'll probably have to do me tour of the qu ay side to start at the beginning where we went
and go all the way round
yes
and then I'd know where I am huh I just can't go to it from this end right I'm out tonight I'm at the join er s with friends so

I'd better go and get our tea
I'm doing ours

when I come back
oh you're going to aerobics
from me leaping about
you still doing your
yeah
right see ya Ann thanks
right Hello
I haven't got much done I've got all the cups and things washed but oh Catherine's just phoned me
wait until she gets her phone bill pay the phone
er m I'll get have I got time
I've got time to do the potatoes before I go er m
have they around a bit
she said yeah sheer m the reason that women who does the earrings couldn't make them for me was that she buys all the parts well the flower earrings she makes she buys all these parts and she ex assemble s them which ever parts you want
mmmm
the colours and everything and the order you want them but the little figures er m she buys them and she just paints them and that's how she could make er the ones for Shirley er for mee rm she gets little soldiers and she can paint them in the camouflage dress
yes
you know the er the para smock and er
with the red hat and she dyes the red hat
but in no it's not red it'll I think it's military police er m that's how she can do it with ere rm a maroon beret because she said to me did I want a peaked cap and I said no the the ere rm maroon beret so it shows its the parachute regiment
what o her m there's something I've just thought of though when they wear the er camouflage things is that when they wear the maroon belt round isn't the ka ki belt with the dress uniform
anyway she said er Catherine said she was surprised that the woman couldn't do it for me before the end of June
but Catherine cos I didn't know Catherine sells stuff for her
that's nice
that's how Catherine gets such a lot of stuff by post she she actually
I know she does she does
and er ah but you spoke to Catherine on the phone and I was out and you didn't tell me that part and er m
you sure I didn't
but Catherine hasn't got her number
you have
well I have because we have er m we've got that Durham and Wear side telephone directory so I gave Catherine the number and she said she's got to ring her tonight about something I think what Catherine must of done was well she must of send orders to her by post
oh
cos they're not X directory if we can get hold of the number er so she's going to say to her could she do it any quicker and I said well the woman said if she could do it any quicker she would ring me she asked for me phone number
You know I'm hungry I feel slightly sick I I think I'll eat er what a digestive biscuit it's a bit late isn't it

Are you at a meeting tonight
Yes at half - p a s t seven
Oh
Do you want me to go up and get you some
Yes please
Ohthere's a piece of I should imagine there's bits of puzzles under the chairs anyway
Sure to be
Oh
at the match last night
I saw I saw bits and pieces of it
Er I was on duty
Do you have any more work to do
Well
When when
You could hear such cheer when they when they got the goal
Oh it was a great goal was that wasn't it
It was yeah and er m there was only Jim and I watching the dog was lying peacefully then he jumped up he started barking he didn't
know what was going on
Peter selling er er a ticket to go he didn't watch it
Jim says no Kat h 's asked him if he would like to go but he wanted to go down to Wembley er get yourself away
If you can if you can get yourself a ticket
Mm
Er he probably thinks he could get one through but he says no I've been once
But the second time they tell me isn't as good as the first time when you go
She says well it's your team
Yes
cos it wasn't S under land that he went to see when he got the ticket the last time
I can't remember who he said it was but er m I've always fancied going
So you get yourself down there then
S under land were there
Oh
I wouldn't have been bothered about any other cos you see it better on the on the screen
Yes
Yes you do
But you you lose out a little bit on the atmosphere
Yes
Unless you can create your own atmosphere
Wellthat's it
I mean you should have all your friends and neighbours in and have a party
Well the last the last time when S under land got to the Final in seventy - t h r e e er there were five of us in the in my house and I'd made red and white rose t tes
we had our red and white rose t tes and when our I was sitting watching the match and when they scored the goal my slippers went up in the air
And Jim er Bill grabbed the camera that was on the mantle piece and he got a shot not of me but he got a shot of Pat and her friend and B ryan and er it was er er something I'll never forget
Mm
it really was So er m but I don't know I I think if Jim got a ticket if he got two tickets and he said do you wanna come
I would
Mm
go like the shot but I I certainly wouldn't go without Jim without somebody else
Mm
But I'll have to get me red and white coat out again
Well you w or work on work on Jim
I mean Pat said he can go so tell him to get two tickets and you'll go with him
red and white scarf got plenty of other reds
I don't know if er
I could I could quickly get a S under land scarf believe me Ann
Mm
There's shop in sells them
Well our Nick used to have er a red the red and white scarf and hat and everything
He had a tie there's drawers full of stuff upstairs belonging to him I don't know if there's anything in there
Do you remember when we used to
I knit him red and white stripe gloves
yes
red with a white tassel on it
Mm
Red and white scarf
Mm
Those were the days
Yeah
Well you know apart from anything else they always they were prepared to give me free tickets for the would never do that
Yes I know
I mean Newcastle we went to Newcastle and they showed us round the ground er when there was no match on and we saw the trop hi es and the directors ' box and various places like that
But they wouldn't let us in if we wanted to go the match we had to pay
But er S under land gave us free tickets complimentary tickets not free tickets complimentary tickets in the seats in the Grandstand
Aha
And er were not cheap seats
No
And then we went round you know where that they had a training place at Washington
We went round there and showed us all the way round
Did they
Yes er yes cos er
When they opened the ground at a few years ago Bill was still alive and er we could go and visit go into the ground and go and have a look round and it was open to the the general public
Er he took me down
it was the tunnel where they came out and all round there
Well we we went in from the
when there was a match on
and we went in from the end and er down the pitch and in through the saw the physio room and the the changing room baths upstairs saw the trophy
Mm mm
highlight in Hazel 's life
And when I I mean when I I a ctu actually felt quite emotional cos I'd not been to Park to see a match for a long time and I mean we're living up here er m and er I just felt quite emotional when I got out and saw that lovely pitch it was in perfect
Oh it's immaculate oh yeah
Oh it was gorgeous
It was in the summer before the season started
You haven't you still haven't told me what this is made of
What oh that's
Jim will you go and g what time does the off - l i c e n c e shut
The Victoria Wine
Cos it's where
Later isn't it
Isn't it later
it's where I get my cigarettes from the Victoria Wine shop
this programme on
And there's this to start with
Er and Mo Mow lam that's why I watched it cos Mo Mow lam was on but anyway all these nurses getting twenty thousand a year staff nurses
No what he was talking about taxation
That's right
And that er they would be worse off because he said even staff nurses are getting more than twenty thousand pounds a year
Which of course charge nurses aren't getting anywhere near twenty thousand pounds a year and only a few er m nursing officers
Well it's nursing officers you have to get into that bracket if you get twenty thousand a year
Yes
Paul was er telling all these nursery rhymes nursery fairy stories rather
There's this there'sthere's there's Hague this Hague fellow who's a tory
Hague is a
you know so I rang up to Ang lia television last night in the programme and objected to this
And of course he had the nurses' pay
this lie
scale in the other hand while he was ringing them
Where's me purse
make an announcement but no announcement was made
There was no announcement made at the end of the programme so and they never got back to me so I rang this morning first thing and last night they didn't ask me my name and address but this morning they did
They got me name and address and telephone number at work and at home so I told the unions that they had to write in and complain about it too
Mm
There you are
Thanks
and er but what I mean
who was sitting in the audience who is a nurse and er would've known and she would've been trying to get in and say this is not true
But she did ask a questions he was the first question that was asked the one about er m
Yesbut that's all very well but bout but er
it's too late then that's what A Angie said Angie said you know they they make this and it's too late you can't undo the the it's a lie
That's right
So there's half the country thinking staff nurses are earning well over twenty thousand are owning earning over twenty thousand
Your Pat said to me on Sunday while I was talking to her she said when she was saying oh well she doesn't know whether to vote Tory because
They've never been so well off
she's done quite well under them
As Jim said in six months time if he's redundant she won't be feeling
Yes
the same
it's true
But she said I said oh
It was the La it was Will Owen and the Labour government that brought
I said oh Pat just just I said have you spoken to a nurse recently
You know how de moral is ed they are and the state of the hospitals and things and she said oh well nurses er they they've always complained that they're hard up and
And they always have been
and the rest of it
So talk some sense into her will you
Just point out that they might be redundant and
Well if the Tories win I mean the pri vat i zat i on will really go to town
I mean even the trusts
The ambulance men in North umber land because it's a trust and they're paid by the trust
That was another thing he said wasn't it
They they
That they pri vat i zed er m ambulance service they're now the highest paid in the country
Which is
and Jim Jim's got their pay scale and and
Well the trust paying them
They're being paid
less
they're being paid less than the N H S
Than than the N H S
ones
I mean just across if they go down to Durham which is an N H S ambulance service
And that's you know anybody listening to that on the television would think oh yes that's true
You know it's it's
over there and you er believe everything they've said
once it's stuck in their head then it's like reading things in the newspapers
What what am I going for
Cigarettes
Er fort well if you if you manage to get to Victoria Wines in time er get me er me r twenty er m no get me forty er Em b what do they call them
Elite please

Forty Elite
If you get to the Victoria Wine in time
I don't know if he will
I don't know if it shuts at five o'clock or what they do or if evening staff come on
I've never tried to go after five o'clock
Mind you Ann I suppose that's why Pat got thinking about a Tory er vote
No she wasn't thinking well she wasn't exactly thinking about a Tory vote
She said well I I don't know what to do she said I haven't read you know she hadn't read the election she hadn't had time to read the election addresses and she's not really interested in ac actually so she hasn't watched it on the television
And I said oh Pat you don't want a Tory government in a again do you
And she said well I I I don't know she said you know we've done alright under them
What does she think's happening to education
What does she think's ha happening to the hospitals
I don't think probably she hasn't really thought it she'sshe's been more concerned with her own self but she's
can't I don't know
I'll have to have a talk with her
Put your daughter straight
I've I've I've often thought I would never vote Tory but I mean I've been better off in some ways in that I was able to buy my council house
But that as far as I can make out is the only thing that I've benefited by you know with them being in
Mm mm
er m
The unemployed certainly haven't been better off
The the thing is
The young people leaving school haven't been better off
Well it would be er m the number of people who are being put out of work
Yeah
and it's not just every week or every month it's every day when you hear of jobs being lost
That's right
It's a it's a
And isn't it a hundred hundred and hundred and fifty small businesses go bust every year
I mean they keep saying we've given the all all these opportunities to all these
a case in point
small businessmen and there's a hundred and fifty
She tried to get she's tried to get started making doing her own business spoke to her the other day and she's well Pat spoke to her on Sunday and she got more out of her than I did
Mm
but er she's not getting
No
Paul next door left school you know he cou all he wanted to be was a mechanic it's it's all he's ever been he's really good
But he's learnt from his father
Mm mm
and he couldn't a job and then I me I mean he tried for apprentice ships all over the place and other jobs and he just couldn't get one
When his father died when he was twenty - one he took over the er m taxi business
Well it was private hire but most of the work came from North gate Hospital
Mm mm
You know they they ran they took the nurses because the nurses home was a mile or was it a mile or a mile and a half or something from the hospital they had this they took them in the morning and then they took them at lunchtime and then all the different shifts coming on and off they took them and they had the schools run as well
And then of course the er they started running down North gate hospital and they closed down the nurses home
So there was half his business worked out wiped out in one go
And then er m his schools run was way up into the country quite a long way and then that was changed
First of all th the er m registration went up then something else went up and then two of his children from farthest away were moving so he was gonna be paid much less than that
Well the ordinary private hire there's so many of them I mean his dad had been doing it for years but there's so many started up
Yes
He couldn't compete
And and then finally the council said he actually had an Austin Princess but you know Paul and his cars that that nineteen I don't know what it is the car he's got in his garage now but he buys old cars and completely re builds them it looks like a new car now and he ha he had an Austin Princess which which actually it was a P re g and er they told him he couldn't run the service unless he bought a much new er car
And he couldn't do it because the pair of them I mean that was that business was supporting his mother as well and between them after they'd paid for the petrol they were taking in less than a hundred pounds a week and that was for the two of them
Two
So he couldn't keep it going any longer and he had to give it up so he's on the do le again
It's about oh it's it's over a year since he packed in and he's t r i applied for hundreds of jobs
He's applied for jobs in Washington and
Mm mm
you know it's quite
I mm mm
a long way to travel to
I read in er
but see you just get nothing
in the paper just last week N is san had er about had some jobs
He wrote to N is san
going
That was one of the places he
and they had
wrote to
they expected they expected a lot of er applications
They got thirty thousand
Yes
P he w
You know it was er it was ridiculous
Thirty thousand
that there there there had to be so many people
Mm mm
who needed a job
Yes
Yes
And they expected a lot of but they didn't expect that many
They say unemployment 's hitting the south now but I wonder how many jobs they get that thirty thousand apply for
Mm
Sorry state of affairs
Yeah
The teaching teaching jobs are the same
Hundreds and hundreds applying for teaching jobs
Rubbish
Is that rubbish
What's this
Something from
You won't get a copy of the completed er thing will you
No
Nope
There's bits of paper everywhere you look
Well I think I'd better make a
Whose key's this
Got mine here
That's not your key is it
No
I'm sure it's not mine
Jim's
Jim's is on his car key ring I'll put it there until I find out
Unless it was a loose one that was lying on here cos Richard was
I've got as many keys at home
Oh I've got
and I haven't a clue I
oh I've got I've
keep thinking I you know I should throw them out or something
I've got keys to these there's an old lady opposite I've got keys for her er m front door and back door
Well I've got
She's got a I think er has she got a no I don't think she's got a key to my house now she used to have er in case I lock me self out
And Betty had but that
then we got the new front door so only Betty now has got era spare back door key which wasn't much good the day I bolt ed the door into the kitchen
Could only get as far as the kitchen
I've been grateful for Jessie having my key because er I've locked myself out one or two
Yes
You know I get out the door and I think I've left the key in the lock
There's something extremely sticky on this windows ill
U r g h
It's all cl a gg y
I don't know what they've had on there I'll have to wash it off properly
oh there's my paper
Oh
What happens as far as patients in hospital are concerned Ann when it comes to an election
Well if they've applied in time they can get a p postal vote
Mm
Er or they can ask for someone to take them
Jim's actually running people from Comfort House there
Someone er asked it was someone who was de living delivering the er m election the poll ing cards
He'd been helping his wife to she must work for the council and he'd been helping her and he said er the ma tron at Comfort House had asked and he and he'd noticed Jim's name on when he delivered ours so he knew where they could he'd take them
The only thing is in a place like that they're more likely to be Tory
However Jim says he'll take them
Where is Comfort House
It's era private nursing home do you know where the library is
Yes
You go past past the library past the ambulance station and round the corner
I haven't been as far down there I've only been as far as the doctor's surgery down that road

get in a routine and
Yeah
pl od on with that year after year
I mean I hadn't any worries
No you know
No
I've never had any worries or anything like that
But you don't realize
Course you have
No
Just being ordinary and
Yeah
You know sort of
Yeah
Yeah
George had no affection in him I found that out
Really
No affection
Now you surprise me cos I would have thought cos you always went round holding hands and looked so happy
Not with George wouldn't have hold your hand
Wouldn't have touched you
Oh
No
No way
The most affection you got from George was a pat on head
Oh crumbs
Oh no you see he used to say about
people that held hands
He used to be quite
Yeah
about people
Oh
I see
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
See it's funny he used to think all people just he used to say oh he's doing that for show
Mm
He'd never had affection so he couldn't give it
No
No
You know but
No
I used to make allowance s for the way he was brought up
Yeah
He was brought up with his grandma and that
Well I
Yeah
thought he's never had affection
No
People of that age it's like David's grandma they don't know what affection means
No
No
They say we're daft for showing our affection
Yeah
But you should do
I only just realized that
Well it's taken me a long time to even be able to give affection
Yeah
I'm sure
When you're not used to it it's
Yeah
funny
Yeah
You know
Oh I think it's all part of it
Oh
Dennis has got more in his little finger than George
Yeah
had in his body
Well I think it's but I mean we can I can honestly say never go er past we always tell each other we love each other
Yeah
And I think you should
You should
Yeah
Even my dad
I give
Yeah
my dad an odd cuddle now and againI'll say
Yeah
I love you
You
Yeah
know
I mean it's just yeah
Well George wasn't like that
He wasn't like it
Well
he was a man's man through and through
Too much
I think
so
I think life's too short and I think as you're getting older you realize I mean like losing my mum
Now he's worse
i
he's worse now is George well I should say worse or better now you see he'll cry now
Yeah
You know
Whereas he didn't before
You know
Yeah
Yeah
I mean all he can say now is I've messed my life up
Yeah
You know well
Yeah
that's it
You know that's it
Yeah
there int anything anybody can do
Well we said over there I bet he's really regret ting how it's all turned out didn't I
Yeah
Definitely yeah
I don't know what we
Yeah
Yeah we were saying I bet George really regrets
Yeah
what he's done
But you see him cos he won't register as an alcoholic he won't
No
won't help himself
No
You know
He thinks he
It's a shame inn it
You know there's nothing you can do
I mean to him now all his life is out till half four in the morning blind drunk
You can't be a teenager when you're fifty
No you can't love can you
But you know don't work
No
And he goes I mean he went to see my mum and dad before Christmas and they didn't recognise him
He's so bloated and I mean I haven't seen him I said I've I've talked to him on the phone
Yeah
But I've told him if he ever see me go other way please
Yeah
Promise me
I said I don't want to see you
Yeah
You know
Bad enough and at least I mean it's not on a phone you can be upset but yo it's not the same as seeing somebody
No
No
So
it's not
Never mind love
Terrible that eh
Yeah

As long as you're alright

Good
Great
So they're just about sorted I think
Are they
Mm
She came round on Tuesday for my hamper money and she said everything was cos I said I'd pay her monthly and she turned up and I said I thought I was paying you monthly
And she said that's right you did say she said I'm all at sixes and sevens she said and everything's upside down
She said she said I don't know whether I'm coming or going
Oh
Oh oh
I know
WellI'll go and get finished and let you get on
Yeah
Get home now
It's boring life really inn it really
David's been away all week
Pardon
David's been away
Has he
all week
Yeah
Come back tomorrow
From Scotland
Mm
All on my own still working heaven
Nice for a change inn it
It's alright first couple of nights but then you get a bit bored
Yeah
after a while
No
Oh well
At least I've got a skirt
Yeah
Well go back and get those other things
Er m well even if I get well if I get er m ski pants
Yeah
well how much will I have spent then
Well you've got eighty
Just spent twenty two pound haven't I
Yeah
There
And er m and the ski pants were twenty five pound so if I spent twenty two there and twenty five that's forty seven
That's a C red a a hundred and fifty nine
Well that's alright
That one's the same make
Yeah
I like that
Yeah
It's got two bits
But you you know what ca cos wo he won't be able to repair it will he
This is nice not gonna go wrong
Well it's made in Britain I wonder who makes it
British Steel
Don't know
No
Does it look about the same size as my other
Yeah
I think they're all standard are they
Yeah
That one's I think that's a bit wider that one
I was gonna say does that look wider
It's the only one really that's all white
All white
Apart from the and that's hundred and seventy
It's a Phillips
But even that isn't really a bad price is it
No
It's not bad no
It's the Phillips
Yeah
That I can get repaired rather
Ah
than just er mI like reason I'm going for that one is my was her is very similar looking
Yeah
and it and it you know it's about the only one that looks anything like it
Mm
Yeah well I'm su it's made in the U K isn't it
Yeah
Yeah
I mean it's got to be the other of course will be probably it's a good machine
it's getting parts and everything
Yeah
int it
And then you can always take out the extra insurance with er no but it isn't very much for a tumble - d r i e r f o r five years and there's no problems that way
Absolutely none
No
Yeah
And wha what do you do like about buy now and pay July what does that entail
Well what that means is first of all it's no deposit
Yeah
free delivery
Yeah
and then er m in July you do you don't have to pay out a ha ' penny till July and you can either pay cash and get your sixteen percent off free or you can pay terms from July
Oh
Yeah well I'll probably pay cash it's just that electric bill's and gas bill's in
Yes I know
I know
And I if I pay cash I wouldn't you know
Yeah
I'm wondering if I'll be a bit short
Well well you can always pay with terms if you want
But there's nothing to stop you if you take it out on terms there's absolutely nothing to stop you coming in and paying as long as you pay before July or by July you get
Yeah
your sixteen percent off free
But then also you've got you if you take it over say twelve months you've got like a
Yeah
big safety net underneath you if you if you find that you don't want to pay it in cash
Yeah
I mean I know it's sort of the cheapest
Right
and maybe you know that's not such a good thing but we were looking at the Phillips er m
M hm
but it's not like that's got dual heat settings
M hm
on int it
That doesn't
That's a auto sensor dryer that's why
It automatically turns the temperature down of the drying
You get a choice on that one
That's why
Yeah
Mm
There's more to be done on that than there is on that really cos
Yeah
Mm
Probably
Yeah you're probably right
It's just that my dad repairs mine
I mean
Oh right
you know and if
Yeah
if as she says he's repaired it so many times
Oh course
Course he does
But that's that one
I want something that that I can look at that for
Er m yeah can I
Yeah
go with that one
Do you want the insurance on it as well
Er m yeah may as well
Yeah alright
If it's if it's not expensive
Hi
It's about the dr i er
Yeah
with the
Right
For this lady
Is it the small or the large Cross ley
It's the large one
The large one
The is it eleven pound load I think it is
It's ten or eleven int it
Er er er er er
It's one or the other
Te er ten yeah
Yeah
Right
That's it the four double one
And how did you want to pay
Er m well I'll pay cash but before July
I will pay it in
Well I can put it in as cash in July but you just pay before then alright
Yes
I fancy some sleeper s
Yeah
Just some ordinary onesjust to stick in and leave in all the time
That's nice as well Tracy
Mm
I like that
Int it nice
That's not
Is it nice
expensive but again it can't be real
Look at that bracelet
That three hundred and forty pound one
Oh that's nice
I quite like that with that plain gold band
Twenty seven
That's nice
pound
Have they got any earrings
I think I like that bro oc h

Yeah
It's no good for let's face it like cos I'm gonna have to start er
No
It's a pity he couldn't stick to something like that cos I mean ex - p o l i c e m e n can get jobs like that no trouble can't they
And I mean somewhere like As da is a better place to work than most
Aren't you coming in today
No

Yeah
Well I've just seen did you cotton on to that it's not just me
You know Julie that had Sebastian
Aye
cos that baby
Yeah
I've just seen her going that way and I've just seen skinny Mick that she used to go out with a she had baby to coming this way
I don't really know her that well
I didn't think I thought they hated the sight of each other
I hope Sarah wouldn't expect Julie to stay any later would she
With her driving the I never thought of that
Gary is he is he the other brother

She sleeps with Gary
Yeah
And how many has Peter got
Just the two or three
I don't know Tracy

Yeah she has
I wonder if it's that every day
I would I would think so
Oh no
She used to be head stable girl didn't she
When his wife were there

But I would imagine that's what she wants to train Teresa up for so she can just run it and she can sort of
Well that's fair enough so she can
Well yeah
What
There's John
Did he ask you about steam cleaner
No
Not at all

Go go and see granddad
Go see granddad
This way
Here he is
It's not Hiya
What's the matter
What are the ser terms
Thirty days
But they're not paying thirty days
I've just explained that to him
And he said he didn't know that that he would get hold of Sen and ring me first thing thing in the morning er to tell me why Sen hasn't paid
He's got the invoice and everything
I said well you've sent us twenty thou I said there is no V A T on it which it should be
Dear y me
He says
Has he got the in vo i
I said yes
And I said we've been having having the invoice outstanding since October at two and half thousand pound
I said you actually owe me six thousand one hundred and odd
And I said you must realize I've a small company and that's in one respect that I've had to send those conditions because you're failing to meet the agreed thirty days payment
Yeah
And I said it's not on
I said we couldn't survive like that
And he said well would you like to carry on with the contract
I said we're too far committed now to I says to back out
I said you know we can't back out at this stage
And I said but I said if there isn't the payments of the invoice when they are sent then you know we've go you've gotta look at it
So that invoice wants
Doing
Yeah
it wants doing and sending and put in i put twenty eight days on
Yeah
Had to be paid it can't be paid by the twenty eighth it's er you know well if I could've got hold of David or er Andrew I was gonna give Andrew a right bollock ing for just pushing it in and he should've sent it to er Michael Michael 's just got it shoved in front of his nose a in Edinburgh
He's just gone in to see if everything's alright at Edinburgh and of course that's why he's had to report for that
Which was fair play to him but bloody Andrew should have told him
It's agreed the system of stage payments it's all written to him
And you've just spoken to him have you
I've just spoken to Michael
Michael's great
And you you so he understands after he's sent you this
What

So he's realized how long you've been waiting
Yeah
And he said it's not on he said what he he said er getting the money he said we've got a lot of money in American bank and he said and getting that back it's just a pain in the arse
It's a bloody nuisance
And it's not often Michael swears
And he said it's a bloody nuisance

Messing about with

Cos if there's any handwriting on it I'll forge it for you
It's just rid i culo I mean she wants to write that down really I'm I

Trouble is it's you know I worry
about her being getting in

What do you think next step should be Neil
Do you think solicitor or
No
I think we ought to go and talk to them first and ex p you know put our side forward and if they don't want to play thenthen you have a solicitor
But really you already have
Because you Neil's already spoken to them about how late th the thing was coming in the first place no and they've just ignored it
Well there's no harm in having one last try is there
O i
No
What you doing
Trouble is that
Well if they owe us money and stuff like that we might have to be going to court in the end with it but the only trouble is we're losing that much bloody time taking a day off and going down there
Yeah
This is it you've hardly time
Well that's what I say if you go down on er Sunday but they won't be there we'll have to make a organize a
What
Aye they're a bloody nuisance
Rebecca
You just get sick of problems don't you
It's just seems
Well they tend to come in batch es don't they
You know
Yeah
we have a quiet period for a while and then all of a sudden they all crop up together
I mean at least the one
And you you stand there at end of day and think well is it our fault or what
Yeah
we won't be dealing with anybody else for a while I can tell you
Aye
Well it makes you wonder
Mind you if you look at it like like
Yeahbut if should we say well we a cc we'll accept half of it and and
No
It's we we shouldn't accept anything that you know we we don't think's correct
In fact we know it's not correct
Yeah but they might say well alright then and then pay out and as it is we're gonna have a lot of messing about haven't we
Anyway I'll get in touch with Mike and see if er
he's heard from insurance people for cos I've already asked Mike
But
he said he'll ta no to court if it goes to court cos the insurance we've got out

Oh
Look at that
Isn't it straight
Look at that
It's come out
Oh
I've got someone coming
Yeah it's funny usually find with join er s I don't know i they're supposed to have a good eye for s t ra i
Yeah
but they haven't
I know
It's amazing that
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
And I well I he didn't get here till about half past ten
But
put a nail in put something like that that's about right no actually it's not
Is it just held on with like a couple of nails or
Yeah
Yeah
Then it's put on top
Won't get that back from
Right
I'll see if I can
Was it
down there
Mm
That was
I'm going to put it out there where they won't
Mm
No you've done
Mm
you've done very well
Haven't you really
Your first your first year
Yeah we did well but er m we shouldn't have like you learn by your mistakes but we we kind of made profit and we shouldn't of done
Yeah
er m and now the tax man has hammered us so hard
Yeah
that we're really struggling
Yeah
Yeah
And we're really having to struggle to sort of make ends meet
Yeah
I know what you mean
You it's a diff i it's difficult
It's wrong int it
just striking up that balance int it
Yeah
Isn't it really
And of course now they when we originally moved in here we asked about the rates and they said oh they co they wouldn't raise it because it was an unfinished project
Yeah
and nobody had paid rates and they wouldn't pay rates until they'd actually finished building on the land opposite
Yeah
Anyway when the accountant came in to do the books he said er oh he said you've got to pay something
So he said I'll get on to them myself
Anyway apparently he was told exactly the same thing as I was told
Yeah
but of course it had kind of stirred up a horn et s ' nest
Next thing they were down with the measuring up and we'd just got a four thousand pound rate bill
And they've actually rated it at ten and a half thousand er m payable
Yeah
three thousand eight and of course well Neil said there's V A TI didn't think you had to pay V A T on rates
I didn't I didn't you know I don't
You know
Yeah
Er anyway so tha that's sort of you know made
Mm
a big difference
That's suddenly four thousand a year we've to find
Yeah
I mean if it's crippling us is this place
Yeah
If it wasn't for this we could be it would be quite good
Yeah
Yeah
But what can you do there's nothing else about
No it's that's it
And a lot of businesses up and down are er are in a bad way really
Yeah
Some very sailing very close to the wind
Yeah
They're all finding it hard aren't they
Well there's less and less work and the work that does seem to be about is that competitive ly priced that
Yeah
you know it's neg ib le whether you can make anything even if
Yeah
you get the work
Yeah
And then of course er money is floating round very quickly
No
No
I erin fact we yeah we just had a problem yesterday we started work for the Royal Scotsman and er m well we started work for them like last year and we've been doing jobs
Yeah
and we've had invoices outstanding since October
Yeah
So Neil said well these invoices weren't forthcoming so I said to them the thing the thing is if we start work and we buy a load of equipment how are we gonna sort of how long's the cheque gonna gonna be coming in you know
And you have to fund it
So we asked for twenty thousand pound upfront
Tt
So anyway and they said and before we wi we get this twenty thousand we also want the ou October 's invoices clearing up as well
So that was great
Anyway we've waited and waited we've rung and we've rung
Eventually a cheque came instead of being like for six thousands er nearly seven thousand it came for four
Yeah
Er m the twenty thousand eventually arrived no V A T.
You know
Yes
and all this sort of things
So of course we were getting a little bit panicky cos what's worrying me and it still worries me again we've put all this time and effort in they may pay us alright we've got this twenty they may pay us a second payment but are they gonna pay up on the third
Well tha that's always the catch isn't it
You know
The last one
Yeah
So we actually wrote down er m th the equipment that we were buying was ours until paid for in full
Yeah
By them
Yeah
And we sent this letter up to them
Well we've had their director on the phone phone yesterday and more or less demanded his twenty thousand back
Yeah
and if you don't want the work we'll take it elsewhere and all this
Mm
Er m
Puts you off doesn't it
Well I mean what on earth do you do
Yeah
Very difficult isn't it
You just well Ne both Neil and I have sort of felt well to be quite honest it isn't worth it
Yeah
For what you make at the end of the day on on somebody's
No it's not worth it
It
Yeah
well it the running the business isn't I don't think because by the time the tax man's hammered you
Yeah
you know the V A T man wants his money I mean the V A T man's been paid for all these invoices
Yeah
and I still haven't got the money in
Yeah
Yeah
You know
Everything's against you
Really V A T' sI think and I think it should only be paid when it when the invoices
Exactly
have been cleared rather than always paying
Exactly
for that quarter
Yeah
even if you've not got paid
Yeah
Exactly
Er m mm I don't know whether there's any way round it but that's sort of the set up that they gave us when we started and I guess I'll have to sort of con form to that but it
Yeah
does seem unfair
Yeah
That's right
I mean now there's a couple of people qui b bling about actually paying at the that we did
Yeah
There's still six hundred and odd pound outstanding
Er m I can't honestly see us ever getting that
Yeah
Er m the fun i cu lars they're qui b bling about the final payment
Yeah
About them being late and everything else
Er you know it's just a and I've paid for that and that and
There's extenuating circumstances like that
Oh dear
though isn't there
As Neil said
Well yeah
Changes in specification
Yeah
er equipment coming in late er
Yeah
you know I mean
They don't seem to want to know though
I mean Neil's tried to explain to them that they were late with drawings and everything else it put us way behind in the beginning
Yeah
But all you know they've just not listened to him
Yeah
So
Yeah
I guess it'll
It's er sta l stalling they're
Yeah
cos that's all it's doing inn it
Yeah
Well solicitor said she it sounded to her as if there's something more to it
Maybe they don't have the money
Yeah
Yeah
And they're stalling all the time
Yeah
Yeah
But er m you see they suggested going down for a meeting he's up to his eyes in it
Yeah
And
Yeah
he can't honestly spare time to go down there
It's costing you money isn't it
Well yeah
And chase your own what's due to
Yeah
you
That's that's the
And we know you're gonna have an argument
So is it worth it
Yeah
Yeah
I I I personally feel that give it to solicitor and let her deal with it because
Yeah
Yeah
just not worth the hassle
Alright
Yeah
that's gonna cost
Yeah
but but I mean you can only make it worse by like you say you're wasting your own time and money
Yeah
you're not gonna get anywhere
Yeah
Yeah
All gets
I mean
a bit ac rim on i o us doesn't it
And er
Yeah
Don't it
er that sort of thing starts happening
Oh it's painful
Yeah
It really is painful
Yeah
It's getting ever more difficult isn't it
Doing
Yeah
business
Ever more
Yeah
You just Ith all this bump h about sort of trying to help small businesses and things like that they do nothing
No
No I know that
They do nothing at all
Yeah
No it's er as you say all all the cards are stacked i in
Yeah
such a way that it makes it ever more difficult
Yeah
The trouble is see you know you've nobody you can go to you you've nobody that sort of will listen to
Yeah
to all this and do something about it higher up
Yeah
I mean they just keep hammering and hammering and more and more are going out of business
Yeah
Alright th the saying in the paper they're talking about stopping these big companies keeping these little companies waiting there could be something they can do about that but how long is it going to be before they do something
Yeah
Yeah
It's a
In the meantime there's more and more going bust every week
Well the trouble is a lot of these MPs and people on these committees are actually they've got seats on the boards of a lot of these big companies
Yeah
so it's not in their interests to push this through
The longer they can stall something
Yeah
like that
Yeah
er you know the better it is and particularly when you look at the the fever that there is at the moment about election ee ring
Yeah
is is no big business isn't it
No that's true
I mean maybe I should go and see local er m M P or
Local M P
whatever and and about the rates
Yeah
And see you know if they can do something about that maybe it'd be right time
Yeah
Bu cos we're actually the only ones that have their rate bill Barry's hasn't
Yeah
So you know they're
Yeah
just expecting us to pay
Yeah
Yeah
I would
And it's Yeah
That's what they're there for
Well yeah that's true
Whether you've voted for them or not
Yeah
And you know in fact
Yeah
you pay your taxes and and
Yeah it's very true that
you know it can have
I might do that
Yeah
Because if if they've singled yourself out it's obviously it's not right is it
No it's not
Well I said well I'm not paying mine until somebody else gets theirs
Yeah
And have to pay theirs
Yeah
But er m I suppose next thing'll be a court demand and how d'ya fight that
Yeah
So
It's all a worry inn it
Yeah int it
Oh
Headache stuff
Never mind
Yeah
Yeah
Never mind
Oh well keep your head down
Yeah
Yeah
At least there isn't the same hassle as there was at Cal per s
Yeah
I mean alright yes you sort of have worries but most of the time I mean for all last year it's run pretty well
Yeah
It's only just recently that we sort of starting our de we've had bits of a gg ro
Yeah
Or at least like
So
with this a all the benefits are you get them personally don't you
Yeah
Yeah
Er rather than
Yeah
doing the same amount of hours er and somebody else benefit ing
That's it
Yeahthat's it
Yeah
Yeah
I mean it's like his car for instance I mean that's always been a dream he never thought he'd ever be able to afford a new care rm
Yeah
you know
Yeah
And er of course that's like a dream come true for Neil so
Yeah
that's
Yeah
why we want to make a success and he don't lose it all
Well you know you've got to have er benefits of of taking a course of action like this haven't you
Because
Yeah
otherwise you know
Yeah
what's the point
That's it
What's the point
I mean i
That's it
It's not that people want to get rich it's just that you make a nice living and enjoy
Yeah
what you like doing and that's it
Yeah
You know
Yeah
Yeah can well do without the sort of the hassle and the a gg ro
I mean Cal per s have made it a lot worse for us
Yeah
They have
They've done
Yeah
everything possible to make life difficult
Yeah
But er hopefully they'll leave us alone soon
But it doesn't help when we bring people like Geoff you see cos Geoff comes from Cal per s
Oh I don't oh right
Oh yeah
He did
I de I didn't recognize him
Really angry about it because they've had to bring somebody else in to do Geoff 's work
Yeah
Yeah
Right
So I mean it was Geoff 's choice
Yeah
Well this is it I mean people you can't make people do things I mean they've got to
No
want to do it haven't they
So
Yeah
This
well
is it
we've done very little there
They ju just don't seem to be doing any steel work at all
No
Well everybody keeps telling us they're not doing anything
They just don't know how they're surviving but they keep going on
Yeah
Yeah
The man he must have plenty of money to keep it carrying it
Yeah
as he is doing
Yeah
Yeah
But er
no doubt it'll all come out in full ness of time
Well yeah
won't it
It will won't it
Yeah
Things can't carry on indefinitely in any business
No
where nothing's being produced can it
No
Oh well he's he's told the lads that it's only a matter of time
I think that's what more or less decided Geoff that yeah he would take it
Yeah
But er m
There you go
Well if he's I mean that's what you want inn it
Well yeah
Somebody who can turn yo you
Yeah
know do a bit of everything
Well it means you see apparently Geoff 's done all the air braking at Cal per s it means that Neil can actually some of the time be here rather
Yeah
than up there all the time with them
Yeah
Yeah
Well cos David really doesn't know anything about the air braking or anything like that
Right
Mm
So
Very good
Anyway I'll let you get on
Yeah it's nice to see you again
And you
Yes
Gotta go and see the guy on the end now
Oh yeah
Haven't haven't met him as yet
He's they've opened an account with us and had a few bits and ba p s off us so
Mm
Mm
Yeah cos er I think Neil was telling you that they look as if they're gonna be buying plenty of gas off us if we when we start taking the air products
Yeah
So
Yeah
He's seems er he seems okay
Yeah
But that's a big company I think
Right
Yeah
Well
But
I think so it looks
Yeah
it doesn't it
I think we're only little one here
Yeah
Right
I mean next door he's a big company based in London so
Yeah
Yeah
And we're struggling
I'll see you

He's coming out
Yeah
Hey they must have had a good meal other night
They spent eighty odd pound on a meal
I asked him did you have a sweet
He said no he said th that you could either have one or the other
It was a lot weren't it for
They have a sweet or a starters but they didn't have them both
There's one at sixty odd which is I think r i quite reasonable for three but eighty odd for three of them
It must have been a right
of course it was
posh
more expensive
Yeah it must have been
As long as it were worth it
Never saw you weren't meant to and he says no your mum said that we could either have a sweet or a starter not both
Yeah
It sounds awfully mean don't it
I I said to your dad I said it's mm mm you know to actually say you can't have
Well if they were if they were going home they wouldn't be having a starter and a steak and a sweet and all that lot would they
No but they are inconvenienced cos they're away from home but
But i i it's just
Well I don't know I feel happier now your dad's had that bit of a do with that bloke cos I feel that we can go to him
Yeah
and and wi you know hopefully get paid there shouldn't be any problem
Cos that er m that Sen that accountant obviously isn't up to much
He promised your dad oh it'll all be sorted within twenty four forty eight hours and that was how many three
Yeah
four days ago
I don't think he knows everything ab about that or what
Er m he he told him this morning on the phone he's looked into it he's the director and he apologizes
He rung to apologize this morning and said that it will be sorted and you will have your cheque
He said I am sorry
I didn't realize things were like this
That's why you sent them the conditions
Wellthat's what Andrew said
If if they'd have if they'd have talked to Andrew first Andrew would have told him why we'd sent it
Andrew can't he's just sort of passed that that on
Why has it gone to somebody who
Well apparently it had gone to Andrew and Andrew had cos Andrew isn't in the office all the time and he'd left it in the office and I think they faxed it by th Andrew was gonna talk to somebody about it but of course by the time he'd got there it'd already been done and this had happened so I'm gonna ring er m Job Centre when I get home
Yeah
I they'll say I know what they're gonna say
Like you know there's nothing they can do
That's why she'll be better to stick it and then she was to Aunt y Anne's
At least when she finishes at with Aunt y Anne it was seasonal
she she Anne's gone Aunt y Anne's she won't have to go to that job
Yeah
Oh God
I've
I'm starting to get a bit like that
Yeah
Although I seem I slept alright last night but I think when you've got things on your mind no I didn't sleep alright I was too warm I tossed and turned most of night
I was really warm
Did you you watched the programme the Queen did you
Yeah
Weren't it good
Weren't it good
I'm gonna
Yeah
get the video
Just it's half an hour wanted to watch that on B B C two half past eight to nine o'clock
Oh I think it'd be nice to have a video because like when Rebecca gets older er m cos I personally my own feelings are that we might get Charles as King but after Charles there won't be anything cos they'll do away with them
D'ya think
Yeah
I think it will get to that
There's more and
In the end
people against
Yeah
Int she gorgeous
Yeah
I'll say
It was nice to see and it is always nice to see the the other side of them
The natural side

The frames and everything is th the only bit of wood is the wood on the inside on the panel
You see David what he's saying to your dad this morning let's get a meeting and go but I just feel that I just what's the point of going for an argument
Yeah
And and it will be won't
Yeah
it
I mean because your dad isn't gonna agree to what they're saying
No
And well I'm sure David won't anyway
Because David knows how they were built as well as your dad

does
Well they've spent enough hours on them int they
Yeah
And we made very little money on them
Yeah
And they're saying if they do get away with knocking this money off
We won't have made anything
We won't have made anything
I mean they got a damn good job cos that cos what we charged them we charged them sixteen thousand each
Well you think about how they were constructed and the number of man hours
Yeah
Nothing really is it
No
Yeah
Are you coming pop in
Try and get over the bumps. as well that I go into work and don't see Teresa that often you'd think she'd have the money ready on Friday morning wouldn't you

There isn't
I mean okay Peter give us it on Friday but wouldn't you have thought I mean thirty quid

You eat too much rubbish don't you

You are one little starved girl aren't you
Yes
And what does solicitor say
Have you er er have you taken all your papers and your drawings and everything in
No
It's with it's got to go through we've got to see if we can get all the fees paid yet
It's going through that system and once they've given us the go ahead then we can go to the solicitor in Lancaster
I see
And then fee I can't see how he can well do you wrong when er er m fancy and they're trying charge for a an hire of a crane
Yeah
Not your fault they had to hire a bloody crane
Pathetic
No it's Tracy was telling David and David said David was saying same thing David wants to well like was saying this morning to Neil we'll have to get a meeting up a go
But I was saying to Tracy I can't see the point of going just to have a row because that's all it'll end up I don't think they'll get anywhere by having a meeting I think they'll just row
Because they probably they won't budge
You see Neil's already put his side about we worked er how can you hold us responsible for them being late in when
That's it
for a kick off anyway you held us up for three five months with drawings being late
Three months
Yeah
Yeah
Whatever it was
They don't really understand that
Before you let us have i the drawings
And there was all that messing about there and then we couldn't foresee the wagon having two puncture s blahblahblah and the rest of it
That's right
You didn't
But
do them
they've just co totally ignored it you see and still put it down so they're obviously not prepared to budge
No
Well

Yeah
Well you know
Will I
Shall I
Wait while your dad's out of room
I don't think you can do anything about me not getting an er m they should just pay me more shouldn't they if they ask to
Well Jake was saying that he actually why you're owed the forty five quid is he put us down on the wrong one with your
Yeah
I do less than her but she usually a ten ner
Yeah you see this is it isn't it
She's teaching you
It's whether you feel
Well I'll say to her rather than you teaching me I'd rather you paid me
You won't will you

To daddy
want you to work later
Well just say to her you know working later is there any more money in it
Mm
It's not
That's the only thing you need to say
It's e
It's not that she could be of fenced at that about that
It's extra responsibility and everything
If she's gonna go off and just leave you it's it's all extra responsibility int it
Well naturally
I mean yeah
I Jake's as Jake was saying
About to say ask Jake for
you want more money and all if you're doing extra hours
Yeshe says er
I'd get more money alright
Mm
He says that that
Well I reckoned up this morning we reckoned it'll perhaps be at fifty two but we were wrong weren't we
It's actually forty is it forty nine and a half hours it'll be
I was only working forty hours at Post House
On the but she said er m that she were going away and I could work cos the lessons finish on a sa start up there on a Thursday she said if I work Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and I could have Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday off

We co we've tried to pull but if you pull all the swap the the leads round or shove the brush leads round which is the obvious thing to do in that case you know er in that no they're successfully s parking excessively

I'll we'll do that then when we're ready
We're just trying to save you money you see
Yeah
Yeah
We need er m er eventually get the er the roller
Have you
You got invoiced for it as well
I apologize for that

So are you gonna
If there's any tools wise er er m
No
No
we'll use your side if you don't mind er
whether it's electrical or not
Er
Right fair enough then
Er
But one thing I must s tip u late
Nuts and nuts and bolts and stuff like we'll deal with the other side
But
Yeah
we'll deal with you for tool side then we'll be lot happier
We have a a weird system how it works and I've got my hands tied behind my back er m if you're on with fasten er s you can't use Power Tools
No
Until I break free and go into my unit
Yeah
Alright
So but there again if I get the enquiries f as I mean that obviously is the enquiry came through to me so obviously I quoted on it but
Yeah
anything like nuts and bolts fixings fasten er s that type of thing go has to go through the
They only stop them cos I hang on to choice int draw
Well it's
The thing is because of the profit margin I mean
If there's a Cum brian Fasten er s one in there give it take it back
Because of the profit we're
we're making on the hand tools things like that er works with our account money cos you get a thirty day account
So if you go on thirty days unfortunately we we'll enforce that
Yeah
Nothing personal
Tha that's er m yeah this is
Well they haven't done it that with us we've been on the thirty days and just no
Well our fasten er s in they might allow you to go to forty five days
Well what she normally does
Could of given you
I've said to her it's
Mm
it's it's normally me who forgets to put
Oh yeah
the bloody cheque in post

She e
I just said to her you know just tell them
Not worth getting out of bed

The trouble is
Well if I go on the premises work with me and he's trained like you had one for Steven
Well we've got one here
Yeah
Yeah
And I've just as a basic figure I mean they give up to a certain figure o before their hours you put a bit of tax and after that but er we've allocated him to work in the afternoons when I'm out they al locate to her the warehouse because I can't afford any er as I say they repairs a machine it goes out faulty and the on us is on me and the company
Yeah
and he ha he hasn't been trained up fully yet so he you know but plus the course he's on at er college isn't doing him any good
That's what happened to our drill you see you've had apprentice on it
You're right
I've I failed miserably so I thought I've had to put the apprentice on it you see
No it er
Things can only get worse then
Probably
I gi him general things on their own I mean it's it's really quiet
I mean I as a company Cum bri a Power Tools will always you know it will survive because there's only me and this
Oh yeah

The only trouble that a lot of people I think Cum bri a Fasten er sin one respect
Shall I do it now
Yeah

And see what's happening
they would have a lot more customers whatever the price
Cos you want to get cracking don't you
Yeah
The they lose a lot of customers er to to other people that sometimes charge them more
And we get pissed off with Cum bri a
Yeah

His hand went up just the same

some of them
will i willing and a a kindly nature but we if it's in the middle of a game you know and er you know how you are when you're playing a game well they'd fetch me away to run for some cheese for an old lady
And I I ran there and ran back to continue my game at play like and I heard amo her say to mother well I like your lad to go says th look at this cheese it's never been unwrapped he said those other lads he says it's always looks as if it's been unwrapped and
M hm

And er it's funny that though how they all come out to look
But still they used to go and fetch meat there used to be horse slaughter er s near

And she k e said yo when th one day when there was went out for play time quarter of an hour they rang the bells he asked me to stop and help her with some papers

One of the last jobs of Leicester service man Ta f f y he retires shortly has involved working on a machine of the type he first handled fifty years ago when he joined the B U.
The machine an original Boston Tack er from the early nineteen hundreds was prepared by Ta f f y for showing at the exhibition this month at Well ing borough branch
The organizer s of the exhibition wanted a Boston Tack er to stand in the fo yer to tie in with the the me of the seventy fifth anniversary of the B U locating however locating the complete model has proved something of a headache like the Model T Ford the Boston Tack er was always very common but is now something of a rarity and the branch had finally settled for head to be borrowed from C and J Clarke shoe mach i museum in Street Somerset
Luckily Ta f f y returning from his annual holiday remembered that there was a complete Tack er in the factory of a local manufacturer still being operated
The directors of the firm kindly gave B U permission to borrow a Tack er for the exhibition and after Le Leicester branch arranged a temporary replacement Ta f f y began working cleaning up the machine to showroom condition
Ta f f y spent five days cleaning polishing painting he copied the motives which were missing from and old nineteen hundred and eight B U machinery catalogue which he examined with a watch maker's glass
Ta f f y spent the majority of his time at B U as a service man at R is den and Leicester branches but had an eighteen month period during world war two assembling jet engines at Power jets We x ton His wife and he lives in Spence field are a of Leicester

Course you can
Over eating can do it can't it
I mean look at er George Bush in America he's tried to act like forty as I've tried to do a and you have to pay for it

No I'm warm enough
I'm not very warm
It's getting dark isn't it
I mean you did the same with that as you did with the other didn't you
The only thing that was different is that that it's not starting on the same
Well you get obsessed with that but you're comparing it with yours
I was just sitting figuring it out
You're comparing it with our
You know the ones you put in
thing with our system
Well no y she couldn't put the B side in cos she s you've got to put the A in
Yes
You put the A in
The only way you can get it
A
right would be putting the B side in but you've gotta start with A.
It's rather curious that
Well you you always do on yours when you're recording on our er set don't you
But you're obsessed with the position of the the tape
Well I compare like with like don't I
What's this one in here the d
Leave alone and I'll sort them out

Normal

Well you'd better leave it off then for now
Well I don't know it's
Well if it's better for you I should
I don't know that it is
It gave me a bit of support but
Not much I wouldn't have thought much it's elastic
I know but I should have thought by now it 'd 've been better
Look in the doctors' book it might tell you how long you have to suffer
Well I think as you get older you take longer to heal
If it's if there's not any frost we could go to Sa ins bury s in the morning

It's it was it was er er sheer coincidence that B ever ley had been to C re te the year before and I said to Jackie we've been to Yugoslavia four years do you want do you want a change or do you wanna go back to Yugoslavia she said well I'll I'll have a look I said how about how about going to the Greek islands for a change
Yeah
she said alright and we changed and Yugoslavia came out like that
Yes and you 'd 've had to have cancelled anyway wouldn't you
One of our friends that we'd met were there they'd been there a couple of weeks
And they had to come back
a week before the July fortnight and they had to come back
I always wanted to go but when Ti to died I said to Arthur ooh it might be a bit risky
And then it got that it blew over didn't it
Mm
Yeah
And so w
Well I mean when we to go I mean the tourism and they were just
we've never been
beginning to bring them up you know
Yes
give them a better style whatever yeah
Well someone gave me a lovely address in er m mm
But they made us so welcome the tourists you know they were fantastic
Mm
Well I know everybody er I've spoken to really thought
Yeah

No it wasn't
No no it was cheap i i i it was er when we first went
It was getting expensive
Yeah
it was a lot cheaper than here and when we last went it wasn't quite as er as cheap there as it was h it it was always cheaper than here but not quite such good value was it
Mm
No
No
It was still very good
Have you lost your headache from this morning

They all we
Mm
were quite pale and I thought here we go it's me next
And er
What about Bush then
He he passed out didn't he
Collapsed
Yeah
that was terrible
But I just remember
But mind you he's a bit he's a bit silly looking back at myself er er three year or was it two year back or one
You know I I've got a big laurel and it was coming right over what we call the round about so I decided to have a go at it
Well I got some foot long prune r s but the branches were hitting our thing and I were doing this and you know and now I've got
And that's what's shoulder
a frozen shoulder in each when I go like that in be do oh it's terrible
And er I thought I can do what I did at forty and I did it but look what I've got now
Yeah
Mm
And that getting back to Bush he's doing the same thing isn't it
He's been jogging he's doing some football ing
Well it's the pr the pr the pressure the pressure on him to be
Take that picture from the it's come off that hook
Yeah it's handy to put up
Well my I rang my sister said are
That's a really good picture that
you coming round tomorrow afternoon
Tom
It's a bit odd isn't it to say the least
because it's her er daughter's birthday and I usually give a present to take round
Ooh she said er I've got a bad cough
It seems unusual
It it w it would have been nice to have asked him you know how come they took it
What was the reason for it
Is that the one that was poorly over Christmas
Yeah
Because it's not very high up
No that was young sister
No it can't be can it
No no

Unless he's got a er
Mm
er er
Well I was out there watering at time scares was on and I had this letter and planes did come over and I laid me ho hose pipe down I mean you know so he wouldn't be able
Well planes are always coming over cos there's an airport just over there that's right airport
It's the a e rod rome yeah
Yes but why did he say why's my grass greener than everybody else's
Yeah well that was just a comment silly
Ah I don't know
I don't think they could say anything as I say there was no hose pipe ban then anyway so
You say just a comment comment what about that letter we had
Yeah well
It seems to be a pain in the neck me cleaning the sometimes there's a lot of dog dirt on yours as well as mine and I I and they were quite er happy to do that yet it seems to irritate somebody over there
Still
What about Mrs
Nice isn't it
Breaking her ankle
Put those
Put them on the floor Jackie
How is Mrs
I've not heard
She came across for the first time today I was out egg yard getting some eggs
Mm
and she p odd led over she said she'd been across to Fer n bury Lodge for the first time
Oh
yesterday
mm
Cos I thought she m I said have you been to the shop thinking I meant up here
Mm
and she said no she'd been to pay her poll tax over there she said she'd had a rest in one of the shops over there on the way
Mm
back so
She's doing alright
I didn't think they were like that did you these satellites
Oh
You know
Ah these I thought they were yeah I was trying to think
I think they they're quite large aren't they
Mm
I I've not been near one I wouldn't know but you have to stand next to them to get an effect to k n know how big they are
to get the er how big they are yeah
That's right
Mm
And it showed you all the sort of countries of the world you know on lights and and that and which light was for which wh when they took us round the er
Oh that was interesting
control room you know
Well yes you you know the De Mon t the stage and the organ and all that
It looked just like that
Mind that glass
er and the man was sitting there at a looked like a lot of
A telephone
looked like a great big piano you know with like the buttons and he were doing this and they've got every country within range on the wa on whatever it was wall or a g an try and if that wasn't too too good he he were doing something and it come up
And and and all he'd got all countries ' television er going you know so you could look at any country at the moment the moment it was producing
Mm
I thought it were wonderful
Aye
It's er marvellous
When we were kids we'd never of dreamt of this would we
Oh no
Yet the kids all seem to er adapt to it just like that
Yeah
Very very
And the the son - i n - l a w ' s got a a computer hasn't he
And his
Mm
the little one she's only four
Mm
and er D er er Dave was showing me how it works and he went out and the little one was saying I'll do it for you granddad look this is how you do it and she starts typing away and she's four
Four
Just you've gotta go on that and she presses it and the chart thing which is press that one and it'll get rid of it all
Doing and it all disappeared
And I thought ooh f you know we were
I know my my sister's er grandson he's had a computer he's fourteen and er anyway oh he wanted a bigger one costing about eight hundred pounds
And now he's they've got one and I think it was about five hundred pounds they bought this one s but they managed to sell the other one for about a hundred and fifty they say
Mm
Now he's got that he says he wants a word processor
Mm
Mm
And they're expensive aren't they
Er yes they are
Ooh he he's m mind you he he reckons that's what he wants to do when he's older but I mean the life or the career of anybody in computers is not very long is it
Because they're changing so rapidly
Yes yeah
I mean my one of my friend's son she was a computer man he was working on his own but he's in his I should think he's getting on for about forty six and he was doing freelance but this recession the people who er the firms who were employing him are using their own staff and they're not calling on him now and er he's not done any computing for twelve months
Mm mm
The building n next to us where we are you know do you on
Mm
Street
There's a big glass building next to us have you seen it it's
Mm
quite huge
And that was all that was all computers all computers
Yes we kept going there when yeah
Th th that's going now
Yeah
because somewhere er headquarters they're going to do the work for all the region so therefore they've gotta go
They're yeah
So all those computer people are out
Yeah
and you think Christ what's
Well er m I mean Andrew he was very clever he went to university and as I say now he's nearly f if getting getting towards fifty well even so he's buying a house and last December things got so bad he took a job as a dust man a at Ans te y he lives
Yeah
at Ans te y and he said well got to pay the mortgage
Yeah
Mm that's right
I mean I could be er mm maybe they're going to give us numbers on the seventeen th how many
What as to
how many people they're gonna keep or not gonna keep so
Oh
we don't know who's gonna go or what you know it's quite worrying really but er
Oh it is really isn't it
Well you see he thought the Gas Board was here forever you know
Well you do don't you
But
Well since they've gone private
And especially these computers where they change every
Mm
every few years don't they
It's it's er
they employed
Yes
they employed six thousand people and when the came they all went to Law Street adjacent to the factory so they could walk across to the job and er look at it now they've smashed it all down it's gonna be an Asian big store
It's all been levelled now and taken away and they employed
No they're not it's supposed to be being used
six thousand people
I don't know whether you go down Val me r Road do you
Not very often no
I went I went there about two years ago to Walkers Crisps and that's just next door to er
I went by but yeah a lot of it's all downthere's still still a part being kept though isn't there
Mm
Oh they've still got a small part there
Ah that's that's the American section
That's right
Mm
American United
That's the
We w we was partner ships you see well when our place collapsed they carried on just carried on a bit because they were connected with Japan
In fact er just before I retired they were saying you know my job's obsolete and that and then and says oh we're opening up a big depot in Japan
So you see it's gone there you see
So you just retired in retired just about the right time
Mm
you know it's gonna be difficult to get another job now so
You're in the drawing office
Yeah
Cos I've been silly in the past I've told Evelyn lots of times and we had a new machine a rapid na nail er it er nailed er army sho er soles on to the at five hun it used to do three hundred and fifty nails a minute and we m made one just for I er went out on the road er to five hundred a minute you see and er we were building the first half a dozen and er er there's two paw l s at the back of the machine
Ooh we don't want to know
Ah but th th th there's a rack and w one goes on and holds the horn post up to the boot while it's driven then it comes out and there's two one's half a tooth so it ensure s one or the other's in and they work like that
So I was spinning the cam round it hadn't got pinned to the shaft just spinning it round on the shaft and these paw l s were doing this and Les the top one he went to K ette ring and then Don the next top one he went to er
We don't want to know all this
r er North amp ton and then finally I went to Rush den and er this top one and his mate come out of the toilet been for a smoke and er walking by I said hey Les look at this and I spun the cam round and it went bang and stopped dead
He said well you've got no bloody springs on the paw l sI says so I picked a tin of springs up we kept it for anybody who wanted a spring for their bike any spring where you know the hooks on each end
Mm
Well they broke off in wear and when you was over hauling a machine you'd throw these springs in the tin in case you ever wanted one
And he said er oh he says er er there's no your spring 's broke
I s so I showed him this tin full I says well look they do break don't they
Anyway do you know the easiest er and at that time five pound were five pound if I 'd 've gone to the foreman and then the er
Drawing office
drawing office I 'd 've got five pound on a suggestion
Anyway in the full ness of time er went to er
You said that
near K ette ring Don went to er North amp ton and then finally I went to Rush den and er I'd been there about a year and all of a sudden there was a call in for Short ener s at so I went down on the bike and er what er the one over me who who was elderly well wasn't over me but he was er he was on my job but the senior man on it he come in the boss had sent him in to have a look cos the er Short ener s were complaining and er then they rang up for one of us he said well I'm not leaving till I've solved this problem so I had to go
But er all he did was you know the two paw l s that go in and out
He made a bit of eight inch wire like er a U piece and the bar at bottom bar of the U held the tail so if the springs broke the tails didn't duck under and smash the cam
It'd smashed the cam and and the lever and bent the shaft colossal expense at that time
Mm expensive
Now him and his mate says ooh er you your spring 's broke
Now I were bloody daft If I 'd 've gone to the foreman and wanted to put a suggestion in I I I 'd 've beat sure they were crow ing abou when he got but I was first really wasn't I
Mm
I I'd seen it before it happened
Mm
you see and three more went like that eventually but er he got the dough and that was it
That was it mm
And Evelyn always says I'm too diff ident to push my plate up and
Well he used to come home and say that and I'd say put a suggestion in but
Mm
Mm
if he did I had to write to out for him
Mm
Still we didn't do too badly
Anyway how long have you got to go before you retire
Ooh eleven years officially
Ooh
if it was up to me I'm
Mm
gonna go in nine
I shall go at sixty three at the latest I'm not going on to sixty five
Not staying longer
and it might end up
No no
There's certain rumours that there's no
Still you might get a a big red und an cy pay out if you do
Well talking about a year's salary
Is that
You get a pension of course but it depends how many years
Yes you get a pension
you've been there and I've only been there thirteen years so
Oh
that's not
Not as good
they said about a quarter of my salary didn't they
Mind you how many years were you in your pension
Not all that many
From the beginning weren't it
No you weren't
No
the B U didn't have a pension scheme till after the war
No no
But talking about pensions i
Do you get a pension in yours
Only my own what I put in no
I've been paying a full stamp since nineteen seventy four
Yesit's a good idea isn't it
Yeah
The sad thing is
Well my friend never paid
T al talking about pensions Tom the chap er cha with the office girls and that and and checking our expense sheets he he er they put a notice on the board you could ante your what in your pension you could a put a bit more into it and I were looking at notice and he says ooh he says it's no good for you he says er w well I told you about it didn't I
Yes
And I said ooh
He said ooh he says you won't get no more if you retire
So I mentioned it to Evelyn and being an office - w a l l a h y o u know and any any e extra money she were all there she worked it out says ooh that it were another ten bob a week you see well we've been
Which was a lot in those days
Mm
Well you had a rise as well
we've been glad we've been glad now haven't we er
So he an ted his up
I mean ten shillings was a we a we was
Mm quite a lot yeah
years ago
Yes but we're glad now
Oh yes because now mind you the B U pension 's quite good because every year we we get a p a percentage increase
Mm
Mm
but I mean ours doesn't mine doesn't I mean mine's only a small one because I haven't done many years there
Ours goes cost of living it says
But er oh that's alright if it does but the B U is is you know a really good one
Mm
But you've got to get some years in to get a really good pension but I've got thirteen and the maximum you can get is forty years but you get then get two thirds of the salary you would have got
Mm
your own salary so that's pretty good for a pension isn't it
You know
Still perhaps you get the earnings thing don't you
Earnings related as well sort of thing
That's being stopped though
Has it
It's gonna be in the year two thousand they're gonna wipe it out
Ohoh
So that's it
Oh dear I'm not au fait with those things now
No well this is why w you know like my girls have got just to take their own now
Take their own private ones see
Yeah
Yeah my nieces are doing that Audrey and er well her husband's self employed so er
See all the firms I've been to up till the Gas Board just gave you your money back for your pension
Yes they did
If they could have said to you would you keep it and or transfer it t I would've said yes please
Well they can do now in those days they didn't
But they they could but they they didn't in my day they just
No
gave it to you back and you got no choice in the matter that was it
No they didn't no we didn't in our place
So that was a shame really as far as I'm concerned
Do you reckon the er
Mm
Although Peter my friend's he he did that but er it didn't come to much they 'd 've saved it or something one job cos he was made redundant about three times and er one one place he was at they're supposed to have kept it and paying him it now but I don't know how they came about that bu because actually they we played him a dirty trick they persuaded him to leave his job and then about nine years or probably less than that later you know and he was out again redundant and you know I think they felt a bit guilty but he only gets about five pounds a week from off that one which is
Nothing is it
No
Er er do you reckon we ought to have had you k n you know we went over to gas I toyed with the idea of fetch ing that do you know you know when this house were built we went looking at a depot where they've got all these grates and I took th funnily enough I took the measurements of the breast and er the only one we found was just that dead on look right across
Is that recorder still on
Oh yeah
Oh ye yes yes it's still going
Oh that's alright finish one tape
Tape and
Mm
well we shan't finish that lot shall we at this rate
Well if you if you finish three we're
You can't very well go in a pub can you
No not really
You've not seen Jackie's new lounge
I er
have you
No
It's beautiful int it
Well it will be when it's finished the curtains are
Have you finished
Well they came and fetched the curtains on Thursday they've got to go back
Why what's the matter with those
Not level the dining room one was two inches shorter one side than the other the tie - b a c k s
Really
were all c r eased and the lounge
Ooh
is like this
They weren't level at all
They came back
Ooh
back and they were disgusted so they've taken them down and gonna make me a complete new set
Ohoh I didn't know that mm
Yeah
And he suggested tie - b a c k is cos it's the pink is the th inner material they're gonna pipe it instead of what they've tried
Oh the mach in ing was dreadful
Mm
Who who was who was the
Well Map les they contract out to this
Ooh
workshop
Oh I see Map les
But
Cos they should be good there shouldn't they
Well this is it the man was disgusted he said oh dear
Yeah
They are very good though they come when they say and they they d they do something about it
Oh they've been very good oh yeah
Mm
Yes
they don't just leave it they'll go and do it you know
They've very good
Mm
Cos we had Line ka r s course they've gone out of business but when he came when the boss came to this one he reckoned one of these was a bit out didn't he
Mm
But this I mean they measured in fact he even measured the track to see the make sure the track wasn't level you know and
Yes
Cos the windows ill is about an eighth of an inch out well in one place
Mm
but he still the curtain was supposed to be something like sixty one and a half inches one was about a sixty one and the other was about a sixty three one end you know
Tt oh that's sad
Oh what a shame
As he said it was Christmas rush I think you know
Yeah oh of course it was just before Christmas
But er you know they've just not done the edges properly either you know
So they've all gone back
Luckily we've got the old curtains
Cos I've not seen it with the curtains
No
Have another drink Tom
Do you want a drop more sherry
just a little drop then
Go on
just a small drop
You pour it out Arthur I can't get that cork off very easily
Tom here you are then Tom
do you want some more
No I'm fine
have a martini
No I'm fine thanks
Have a whisky
No
You can't mix the drinks
I thought Tom might have a whisky if he's got a
that's a funny
Oh I I don't want to don't want to butt in Tom
sometimes I feel I'm sh
Ah never mind about it what about with his new car
What sort is it
It's a Ford Sierra
E Evelyn
Oh it's the same sort is it
Yeah he had a Ford last time didn't he
Yes it was a Sierra
It's not quite the same it was er m
Maroon colour
Mm
Do you reckon he's given th there's been a lot of er goings er to - i n g s and from - i n g s d o you reckon they've had a whip round
No
I don't think he could've been insured do you
Well there's been no end there's been no end to it
Well except for third party how long
It's funny I don't know
Yeah
he left it there do you
I don't know he's a s
Mind you yours took a long time you know that bump Tom had going to his
Mmmm
mother's funeral
That was April it's only just you know
Yeah but they sorted it straight away though didn't they
Yes but I mean you get get the repair done don't you
Ye yeah
Yeah
I mean that looked a write - o f f so I don't know
Well er m
You couldn't
and he said it wasn't cos he
Funnily funnily enough he funnily enough his car's on that picture
It is oh well it is it's there yeah
M Martin said when he
Have you noticed how he he creeps that bit he you know he he don't keep back he he just he gets just that bit behind the
Yeah
you know
during the day cos our cars are not there
No well that's what I said i er and probably perhaps when you were on holiday
The road intrigues me Tom
Yeah
how clean it looks and the you know the marks those black marks they're the joints of the concrete where they
That's right
You know they kept
It looks very clean doesn't it
Can you see the pa v ing stones
They're white
Yeah mm that's what yeah
I've never noticed those before
Mm
Well that's the new bit they did you know the little
Do you know y y you it's a different aspect you go out here and all you see everything at ground level and you can't really see on top of everything
Yes mm s see low no
But on there see you can see all the details can't you at all
Mm
But I was struck I was struck by the frame
I think that frame 's worth it these days I
Yeah
I but I reckon you've got a bit of money in the fra in the frame
Cos I was
Oh that lady who came with this she said er Arthur happened to say he'd just bought it and she said how much did they charge you twenty five pounds or thirty pounds
Mm
So I said no only twenty
So apparently she said ooh he probably charges perhaps if he's not very he reduces the price but funny she said twenty five pounds
She seemed to know about it
Yeah
And it's funny they came together and she she pushed
She knew not quite together
in while I were with the other chap
No it was a minute afterwards because I thought
Well
oh he's come back for the this to show to you
Mm
I thought perhaps he'd been to you and sort of were you interested and he he'd come back
But it was only a second
No
after er sort of I'd more or less half a second and I thought oh he's come back again
But but I had more to do with her than Evelyn but er from what little bits I've g leaned you know er I'm a bit into everything like and I seem to think I've got a f strange feeling that she's something to do with education and they're worried about children not speaking properly even tu
No
Le let me finish
Er eventually they won't speak real English with all this Asian kids in now al all the Asian children have gotta go in any school haven't they and th everything well sooner or later er this mixture of languages is gonna spoil the English language isn't it
Bound to
Yes it's bound to
No what the they'll do they'll put all the words that are used into a computer er from all these things won't they
And then they'll see how many are sort of used a lot and percentage and that's what they'll do
Mm
But as Arthur says though perhaps some of the Asian words will start being used by the English people
Ohoh yes yes
Well it says on the on the thing we have to fill in er if any of the speakers is of non
Non ra er non English yeah
English or something a different race if you like you're to put it down
Because you only have to identify them by a name not not a
Do you look at er C C ill a
not not the su rna me just J John or whoever
Mm
Mm
and but if any of them are of not U K origin
Yes
you've got to put it down and say which one it is
Do you ever look at this C ill a er Blind Date
Oh did you see that tonight
Yes
Did you see t what do you make of that blackie with that lovely lovely young girl pretty as a picture and he were doing this round her and leaning back and his great big lips ooh ooh
Oh I hate it when white girl gets an
Well if you were if she were your daughter Jackie what would you have thought
I know well I ha didn't see it last week but Tom said
No I didn't see it last week
she liked colour ed people or something
Something like that yeah
when they were talking to her
I was where was I
I don't know
We didn't see last week's I don't know was something else on
But Tom said she was saying something about you know she liked colour ed men or
Well she liked one of the colour ed film stars I don't know which one it was though
Well we we're not against we're not against colour eds the fact that er
you you want to keep your race i if you've got a an al sat i an or a a bulldog you don't mix it with a some o you keep them another bulldog with it don't you
And breed your bulldogs else you lose your race don't you
Arthur don't like
Sometimes on the television the the
do you
Not very much
Not really
they were showing something and er one of the er Asian lads says ooh I'm English now and his mate says no you're not you're British
This were in a school playground
Course being at home all day you see we see these things
That that programme that follows that we've never looked at it before Barry more er did you look at that
No
I've seen it before
We saw it once before
seen it once but
He's a he's a bit funny isn't he
Yes it was quite good really

What you doing
And er I said I'm going to pick the papers up he said get back into bed
and I I remember mother saying oh we shouldn't wake them when they're
Asleep

Ooh
Do you want another cup

I mean you are now
mechanism of it so

Well I think some days she's better than others but on the whole she's not making much progress
I don't think she will
I mean
But
it's always been
in other words Peter's sort of stuck with it isn't he
Landed
I mean she's always been that way nervous and
Mm
right from when she was first married
Well I was always the nervous type
You're still neurotic in some things
Being a nervous type
Ooh
I wouldn't say nervous type
Just a bit
What would you say
Neurotic over certain things
Why wouldn't you say I was a nervous type
Well not normally
Er what conclusion has it come from
Well not in the same way Joan is
But you get he t up over silly things
What do I do with the big things
Deal with them as they come up

Well she's just coping just dragging her arms int she
Can't see what she sees in her cousins though can you
All
Well they always did

I'll have some in the then stop
Oh I could take them
We used to take handful at Power jets but they said
You used to repeat
it used to be known as it was a war do war factory but you cut them open it were nearly all casing
They were er little
Well I suppose it was concentrated
Yeah
But ca pe I drink it out the bottle and that's the best
Pour it in a glass and look at it or a spoon but pour it out the bottle hold your breath and Bob's your uncle
It's gone down
People talk about they can't take it that's poppy cock

No she said she gets arthritis in hers and I expect that's what it is with mine
Cos I got a bit before when
More like it's the aftermath of the break

And that was mainly for dog dirt but now it's for other hazards int it
Did you put that clock right after you put

Tom seemed to think he come low last night
did he
mm
oh I wouldn't know I mean these zoom lenses are pretty powerful aren't they
well there is that wouldn't taken him went off to the c h
it was taken about last July
the the leaves would be off wouldn't they
July and I bet bet my bottom dollar it was taken when Jackie and Tom were on holiday because of how their bit of front garden is all dried up and that building at the back was completed
about that time mm
just before they stopped work the day before the July a fortnight holiday didn't they
yeah
they'd got little bits to do but there was
the front hasn't been all their rubble still on the front
still there but they finished the main building
yeah
at the end of June so that's when that was taken you ought to of asked him when you saw him today
can tell his white brick work that were only done last year wasn't it
no been done two or three years
mm
you ought to of asked him when he sold it to ain't ya
eh it were that lady come quick and he
no
he went off quick
no he went off quick but I mean before you while I was getting the money
mm
you should of asked him if you
I was too busy looking at the picture and the frame
yeah I know you were
I were weighing up the value of the frame
not the picture
I like the frame though very much
oh I do its like the mountains
its some mould ing like that
well you know
I bet the mouldings very dear
well you know
cos you know that black stuff well well that was four pounds wasn't it that length
about nine pounds a length for eight feet
yeah sum mat like that weren't it
yes well there's a new shop opened near the showers mark e term new thing brick a bra c its called we'll go in there its got they keep advertising and they've got one in Mayfield Road
oh we'll have a look then sometime
so when were out
so if you don't get it
when you've painted some more pictures
I if you don't bring wood worm with it
no well the you they've got mouldings as well as the frames
mmmm
you've got to paint some more pictures though haven't you first
we've got a got a picture of those just er with er you know with the flowers on so be really wanna is to make them back to the original see they had nowt frames and I cut it up but
yeah pity you didn't keep the frames
yeah oh well I did for quite a while
still I like I'd like them as they are I did
but there was in the coal well they looked a bit heavy on the wall
yes they did
you want a big room really don't
well if you see any in the Antiques Roads how you'll know what to do
yeah
see if they are valuable these days
well there just cast your look but I think cos of the frame was a modern looking
yeah cos you changed it for a
yeah I don't think he looked at these last too much
no well if they come in handy
they those people don't like it altered in any way do they
mm well if they come again I shan't let the say were not selling any more bits
no I'm sure the landlord I'll
well I don't know we've still got plenty
his entitled to the
in he
well there not finished yet are they
well that one is and the one in there
that one's not its not got the flags on the top
well the one in there is
well they they specialize in
nick knack s
no in certain things either
well as far as that s to at didn't offer them any thing because they a chap about forty he reached it
it was it was all tough weather scale of six on you know and I said what how much is that up there and he said ten shillings I said a little bit dear in't it cos ten shilling then was ten shilling
mm
and he says su its a good buy even for that says it you know its a hundred years oldoh well he says it was continental but er
well it perhaps wasn't just what he was looking for
no well he knew what he were looking for something worth when you think
no its not
I bet they come across it as well
what about those paint i that painting before he had the market stall
yeah
it were rolled up in a wood set er cardboard cylinder and it fetched half a million didn't it
I think it was er
I think it were a lot of money
some painting of some homes in er a desert at night it had been missing for er nearly a century
I er the Antique Road shows on tonight
how much was this mm
so we'll have to see
best of it is he hadn't taken it out of the
roll
roll roll you know the box
well he put it in probably didn't put it must of taken it out to of looked at it surely
it'd look like that might of been looking in the markets and that
oh I know
for that thing
well you've done quite well really haven't ya
yeah
collect so many bits Val buy ed it didn't she
yeah oh
that tea pot and plate
she did well to of got them didn't she
and what else did she that tobacco jar oh no
its a pity
you bought that didn't you
pity I wonder what if we'd of had those what they would of offered but they went for sale
I think
and they only fetched twenty five
no they didn't they fetched seventy
seventy was it
remember you said that thirty five of that would of been ours any way
be yeah yeah
but I think a lot of those about they get astro nom ical
they they also there a dangerously expendable on that corner of
mm
that shelf wouldn't they
mm you'd of knocked them down
er you you'd of knocked them down wouldn't ya
you would have or I would have
yeah
you going to make us a cup of tea
I will if you so desire
those chocolates have made me sick take them out of this hot room
what the chocolates
mm put them in the pantry
I thought you were going to put them inside here
no I've had too many I feel sick
I've eat er four some
well there the sort that you only want about a couple at a time at the most
well one one a day I should of thought
How
I don't want any thing in me tea

have you done it
yes
you know what's happened in to get in free er this was around there

that's why it was a bit difficult at first to break down
are they gonna give it us then when they've got it
of course they don't silly they made about twelve pounds or they were I don't know what they are now
I seemed to remember you know when my school was about
mm
I seemed to remember he had one and put it at the back of one of his chairs and
I don't remember
there's something on the radio and I were commenting on it and then he all of a sudden he played it back o her it was about then probably
ohoh I know that
probably not as good as
no there not the same sort they were bigger a few years ago I wonder he's getting on
probably dead most of the people we know are dead aren't they
well you know Gillian the couple who lived next door who went to live at Burn ley

why he didn't
You can fill my tea up

I thought it was finished
well perhaps
linked it up and used it
but its too cold to go in the garage now

oh
when I went in for the steamer
you perhaps took it in there then for
and then I found out it was the back door key
mm
and and the garage was un locked so I didn't bother I probably put it down when I got the steamer out of the cupboard

Have all the birds gone
They went a little while ago apart from that they never came on this end
well yesterday the black bird was there and they ate till late I think I think they roost in that er holly bush

no well get plenty of food any how
Have you given them all those potatoes
Well I crashed them up and its er it ain't I made sure those two slices but they didn't touch them
I think they've gone off potatoes a bit
well you've
about any way so
any way I've only got enough for about two
its not only children's programme the young chap said to the bird expert which is the best er potatoes or bread oh he says potatoes every time
mm
see bread has salt in it doesn't it still potatoes do don't they
expect they do well you always add some potatoes salt to the potatoes but er I've only got enough for about two days
oh
so the weather had better improve I'll just have to buy some more from the milk man
what bread
potatoes I'm talking about
oh I'll got across the Co - O p for me paper in the morning and get the potatoes from the shop no problem
I know but there not very good there about three times as much
yeah well why ain't they any good then
well those people have them in stock for a long time
they seem to sell them don't they
I don't know most people buy them in bags today those in those across the
mm
Co - O p the other week were horrible
how many have you got another day
I've got about enough for about two days might be three
that's alright then
I should think the weather will change before then
mm er got a bit of revert back to the nice
I've not heard the forecast today have you
that's
no I doubt it its
well I've had had a little of
oh I had to switch it off it was no good it was all political wasn't it
mm give it time I mean its talk talk Churchill said jaw jaw but you can have too much jaw jaw can't ya
Did you read that er a bit about him
the documentary that their going to put
yeah
which will it'll be interesting you see listen
says you won't like and then
well he was a bit of a slave driver I mean every body
yes yeah
knew that he was a bit bomb as tic
mm and he didn't do so well in his college days did he
ooh he wasn't very bright
yeah
or he didn't try well he didn't have a very happy childhood did he
no in those days
well you didn't try when you were at school you told me yourself
no I didn't bother and next to me
I mean a lot of it depends on or perhaps his par well if his parents didn't really bother about him
mm
he said his mother didn't and then I don't suppose
well my mother were out working and my dad was non exist ent
and then I suppose er in those cases like yours children don't er unless their sort of er m pushed a bit or the parents show an interest in them
oh you know the Meccano things
mm
try to that there was a clip on it but
mm
he bought me one for me Christmas he came at lo you know loader with er what's that in the bar loader with er m
I don't
when Jesus were born any way this thing clicked on and er it I showed me how to do it and I ain't got the strength of course the war was on and there was er people were borrowing cups of sugar and er probably any way I couldn't clip i the says oh he said to er mum oh he says they clip on easily but I couldn't
well your finger isn't
the next then we moved from Arch l in Lane to Founder Lane where next Christmas I had Meccano that could screw with screws
mm
mm I told you about Bill wanting it
yeah
and then after Christmas dinner I built this windmill and mother and I liked it and he said well its only screwed together I nearly said well you wanted it any way see he wanted it and yet cos I got it it were any body could have it
any body could do it you mean
well that's the same thing in't it
what time is it is it time to put that radio on
what that threefour minutes oh you can put it on if you like
well just try it and I'll tell you what I don't know him
er rather throw suspicion that
it won't be the same
its the same thing
it won't be the same songs radio two
what what I could do I shall put these on and see what it at starts and quickly put
no it sits Palm Court we want to see Those Were The Days at four thirty
mm
just try this Palm Court see if its worth recording
well its
its not on until about two minutes past
well I can get it ready now
two minutes past because they have two minutes of news I think
they we are
Those Were The Days was quite good this week
Yes very good is it working
Yes I think so didn't you like it today
yes
didn't know about that fish did you
well I've read I seem to remember something about it
I mean you've gotta remember all those years back all those things can you
mind you for yea when old Charles's said we crawled out the sea
yes but it seemed a bit far fetched if they said that
but any then look at it like this
if that's been caught now why hasn't that changed
well it's the stop page in evolution
well in sixty nine or whatever
but er you look at it like this then if we didn't crawl out of the sea and er evolve then did we just appear like a flash of lighting
no no I'm not saying that we did we did evolve
oh
but
we must evolved somehow
why hasn't that fish that they caught recently evolved
yes well I used to read a lot of story books travel avid ly and I think I forget all about the author and the story but I remember one portion where they discovered a depression in the middle of a continent where it was in excess of and they'd grown quite a different spec i e
of what men
the human human 's you know I know it's only a story
I know several stages I know that
eh but er
I mean there were several stages before they got to present day man but
yesbut they do know le let's go back a bit further but they do know at the beginning of the world most of it is water
yes
so it's quite fe a sible
oh it is
ififif it was three quarters water er human 's must of been in the water to start with
well not human 's but
well whatever we comes
ante ce dence of humans mm I don't know
I mean we've still got a barren at the back somebody kicks you at the back on that barren and er in the skeleton that's exactly like the barren in a monkey's tail
mm
so at one time the theory is we our we did have a tail
mm yesbut we didn't have a tail in the sea then did you
and then another thing you got
fish don't have
fin finger nails well surely millions of years ago they were claws
possibly
then you've got your two prominent teeth they could of been the tiger's two teeth
mm
and then there's another theory with your feet you know that bit of skin between your toes they claim that was web at one time
well isn't you don't know much of
not know of course there's a wears away with lack of use but when you're in the water you want web feet because there
yeah
the water I'll go through your fingers
mmmm
this this skin here
yeah I know that
it's not pronounced in mine but some er they say that with where it's gone away you know there's all sorts of things that can prove it I mean the obvious thing is we came from somewhere didn't we we didn't just drop here with a flash of light and er they've studied plants and other animals and they evolved
Yesbut plants evolved with men's man's
I hope that they they had had on their own for
a million years the plants did
I don't know probably several hundred million years mm can't really understand them can you
well you'd go mad if you tried wouldn't ya like that man said the other week er you human 's invented god well they did didn't they
mm did you take that tape out in the other room
yeah to cut cut a in that
oh did you know
and the other thing
do you know where it is because it in't in this
yes I left it there to call off
oh I see
well if I've left it there to call off I'm not gonna put it in the case and shove it away
well I know well you want to label it so you know what's on it just reminding you you say oh you'll say you didn't remind me to write it down
yes cos you always right you remind me at the wrong time and the wrong thing
no I don't
yes you do oh I was gonna say something you put me off now
mm I'm always putting you off I put myself off you don't concentrate
well you're al r the point it's greater the things they find it that er three quarter of the world were water once
yes I know you said that you going to have the Antiques Roads how at
and then there's another thing yeahif you like another thing Evelyn you know when they give these rock fo ss fossils out of rocks
yes
big sand stone rocks they find things that fish today er had had got other pe dim ents that million years back same thing but not not not the same as they are today you know well they must of got hold of it to be different from a million years ago
mm
those shell fish things they're always on about in they get out the rocks
five thirty Antiques Roads how on B B C one it's in C lee thor pe s
ten minutes then
huh from C lee thor pe s I shouldn't think they'd get much from there oh they might get some ships might they
yes don't
they might ge term
true then there's another thing about religion I've often wondered they say you go to heaven don't they well so well
well no
no but some sort of place well when when you look at these pictures now the satellites been going twelve months still going through
two or three years
well where's heaven then in all that lot
no
and how'd how'd ya get there when you're dead
well you don't that's just
well then why do they carry it all on
well they don't really so much today people
yesbut you talked listened to a par son on telly he's convinced what he's saying true yet it's only what he's been told in it
mm
with all this killing of children and that and burning them alive with flame throwers what what if this higher high of command why don't he interfere
there isn't
he did in my case
what'd ya mean huh
well wait in the Cathedral and out
and prayed
and prayed when you left me
don't be silly didn't really leave you you were just being stubborn weren't you still are
Did Ken a member of church he didn't did he
Ken no no he always went not church chapel you know he did
oh did Tom leave
no me dad used to say he was an atheist when he was courting Mad ge
oh they don't he don't believe in it now I don't think
and yet yet the children went to chapel
mm
come
but I mean I went to a church school
well probably Mad ge Mad ge sort of
well obviously they were going to teach me religion weren't they
in a church school yes
but you know the breaking up day for the summer holidays and Christmas
mm
the vicar used to come and sit at the back and you know they used to do a little turn you know play in the bands
mm end of term
wanted that old is it the rag and bone people you know rubbish and er I suppose somebody taught him and er he he played in that and er you know did the little towns and the vic the vicar used to come and sit at the back a seat under against under the window and watch perhaps he thought he'd er get some little co
well I expect if it was a church school they had to put in appearance odd times
er yes
No Mad ge Mad ge must of sent the children to chapel
mm
I don't think Tom probably approved but she well actually when they used to come to us on Sunday I used to take them to er to Bel ver Fall me and David Thelma 's husband and he's er his father was a superintendent so do you want any tea

yes you did
that's what
well you get all a era ted then if things are not quite right you ain't got much patience with some things
I set up the and I like how its done
no you don't
until you come along and upset the apple cart
you just dream a lot
you get some weird ideas about
no I don't I know I'm not very mechanic ally minded but
huh you you know how many
I can fathom things out eventually
you know that twice two are four huh
mm you never listen to people and then you think you can just pick it up by deduction
instead of just obeying instructions you just say well that should go that way and that should go that way and to me that's im material if you just see it going see it if its working that's it know where the tops and bottoms of it all I mean I see
that won't that's obviously of won
she she was no I don't see why they had her on last night terrible I mean I couldn't even tell what
that er
that song she or tune she was supposed to be singing
you know in er m
p he w
o her oh John's Wood you know that film where the lad played er sang didn't he
where who sang
Al J olsen with the boy
in that film with Al J olsen
yes er as boy
he had a boy on it was boy on on the front of
well he was a boy
the cinema
yes
well he lost his voice and he started whistling didn't he with his
mmmm
with he he I mean he could of beat er it couldn't he
well they must of had a prof e really good whistling mustn't they but why they brought her on last night I think she was hopeless
that's what I mean if they'd had a good whistler he kept instead of her couldn't he
That man with that ten thousand table apparently he said he use it nearly every day
yeah
he it opened out
yeah
into a beautiful card table and with the pockets
yeah
and er he said he used it every day he said oh er now I know the value I shall have to tell my bridge pals
yeahbut that's what keeps
not to put there glasses
that's what keeps it why its kept so long thenthen he said that
then he said I shall have to tell my bridge pals not to mark the
yeah
because you know in the corners there were wood
yeah
wood inlay wood things you didn't see it to put the glasses on or cups of coffee he said I'll have to tell them not to put the glasses or cups on there
but er any thing that's put in the spare room and left that's when you get wood worm
do you remember when you thought you'd got wood worm in our new table
and it was where they pinned the er the get the lips the circle
They even gamble we were talking about and she says oh my wife knows all about that from where we come from you know live live one like Random Street and which I suppose they had to get where they could she come and looked at it and said oh that's one wear said they're only fourfour holes
they were pattern holes weren't they
mm but there was a bit er you know where the legs moved
mm
when it were made like the sawdust some of that had got on our
and you thought that was them
that's what made me
you you get to annoyed over trivial things so I don't suppose you'll change at your age
probably not
drink that coffee its gone cold
when you think of this
mind its not in the saucer you'll spill that down you
when you think of these er music boxes like George's got and you see on telly
mm
but when it laying here and you look at this little box there okay with the real Don cast er
yeah oh yeah I see what you mean
see what you mean
yeah
they all sit round that Sunday afternoon wouldn't think it were
well it wasn't in those days that were a good programme on on Court today wasn't it
yeah do you wish you'd like it done now
no we wouldn't have it on today we'll have it on tomorrow see how it sounds
I bet it don't work though
mm
I bet it don't work
even when I'm doing the ironing tomorrow morning
Say you're gonna have an early night
mm
I don't think you see you see what that films out in't it
mm we've watched it
o her well it well that was but I mean that's not gone back right has it
don't know
you think it has look you see there that's straight
mm you probably bent it back when you fall with all the pain and you you ain't noticed it so much
I know I told him that was the only part that was hurting and he looked at it and said didn't
alright
say it was any thing to bother about
yeah perhaps isn't cos look at the pain in your frozen shoulder its pain and yet its nothing broke is there
no
disguise in't
I suppose it will come right in the end its taken a long while because look at that lump there
mm yeah
look can you see
mm
shall I have a new wedding ring
of course you can if you want one you'll have to ask about it do ya trouble though a cartoon ring will do just as well
you cheeky thing I've still got the other one but it won't go on but if I had er m
well maybe they'll expand it
no if what where if you haven't got any gold
well cut it through and open it and put a bit in
oh no I didn't
you've got plenty of old rings I can
I haven't got plenty of old gold rings
well you've got some rings can cut a bit off and put in

that was a silly thing to do
and pulled myself over the gutter it were alright getting up it were getting back in

His aerial had come off the chimney

No it's not it's the teachers

I'm going to have to clear up and go in the other room
a severe expression and it wasn't put on
It was built in
We had screens on wheels in latter years at last few years at school and er he used to go down to the tea room for a cup of tea half way down the stairs the teachers' room and perhaps go toilet as well and er the one at the back was a foot out from the screen and every now and then he'd have a look to see if he was coming and er we what had had a big case with birds in and the lads who were doing it looked in this saw the reflection and shh he's coming
So er er after a bit you see he changed them round he he guessed somebody were and of course I got the job
I'm glad I'm getting rid of all the Christmas remnants
I've only got one round case and about two vol au vents
I forgot about that
so
Still you said you want it running d
Yes that's
understand what you're
Well I'm just getting it on the
Well Now have ten minutes with your feet up before you change
Did you know
What
You dozed for about three quarters of an hour
What
This afternoon just after
What were the birds doing
Well they cleared all that chicken now I've picked all the bo
with all this
with all this you arguing and telling me I'm wrong when I'm right and right when I'm wrong

In fact I felt tired and when I went to change I er
Went on the bed

Oh if you'd shouted down I'd've g come with you
Oh no you wouldn't

Well that's a silly remark to make
Well I can rise to any occasion
Pardon

Such as
have to burn it up when you're Feels as if only just gone
Well you know all the chicken bones
Mm I see they cleared it out
They clean ohoh I've put all the bones in the er dust bin
I see they cleared it all up
And I didn't cut you know I didn't cut it up I just left it
About another three weeks we should be out of the real winter shan't we
Should be
Although March can be pretty cold
February
February's usually the worst
February you get wet snow and rain
Mm
Mind you don't burn that c h table
Well you pushed the table nearer the fire
It was you left the back door open that's what's made it the room cold
How was your tea

Yeah
K e keeps your brain active
We've got enough active there
Keeps your brain active
Yeah well use it on there then
By the way is it er
It's still recording I think
Might as well use this tape up and
Do you think I ought to finish the ship first of all or do the oil painting
Well if you've got to go in the garage it's too cold to go in there to finish the ship off so you'd better paint in the house hadn't you
Well if I want to turn something I've gotta keep walking in and out and I don't wanna do that
Well then leave that till warmer weather
It's not ready for rigging yet is it
Will you take that to Tom's or not
Who
Your Tom
If we go tomorrow yes
We might as well use a tape up
Do a pen north do a pen north of it can't you
Perhaps Maggie's got some bright ideas of
I doubt it
Cat h I know who could fill it up Cat h
Cat h
Well we've got to go round there if we're out to because er m we've still got Penny's
Well it'd show willing if we did get a bit of all on wouldn't it
A few more
I mean if if they had ha had nursery rhymes
No don't be silly they just want vocabulary they don't want things like that they want to know a person's vocabulary a to cer you know at a certain age
I think the not doing very well with some sixteen year olds
No
Tim's got that lady friend
I know he w she were on about a room weren't she
No
Why would Tim want to come and live here
I didn't say he would but Cat h might want him to
No course she wouldn't
Anyway Tim's paying a lot towards that house
Mm
You know he paid for it to be
Well that very much when you live there does it
Well
Look what we pay
Look what we
And then the double glazing cost over a thousand
Mm
Glad we didn't have it then
Well it is about about a thousand for one bay window so she's had the whole house done so it's probably nearer three
But can you honestly say you've been cold in this house
No
I've been in digs
Well where lots of people
I've been in digs where you went to bed and you've had to put your top coat on the bed
Mm
There are lots of people let the windows go and it was a case of either having new wood windows
Yeah or get glazed
or or paying the bit extra and have it double glazed
Yes but you can't open your windows in the summer
Well you can with double glazing some
but you can have vents
But while our wood frames are in condition
Yeah what sort of problem is it when you say a kid broke the window like they broke ours what sort of problem is it as opposed to these
Well you get it done on the insurance your insurance covers that
I don't mean that I mean it w is it a bigger job or s
Well of course it would be
Well then
That you take that into consideration an' all
If you get it done on the insurance I don't suppose people worry
There's always a debit side
Anyway it's always er they're tougher than ordinary glass anyway even if foot balls do
Mm
It's not foot balls is it it was er

clipped them off and the wind's blown the flowers from the corner
Wh when I went to shut the gate after that man had left it open I er I went round and dead - h e a d e d them all
I can't understand trades men they come hoping for business
And leave your gate open
and leave your gate wide open for the dogs to come in and and tear your
Plants
plants up
Hmm
But I mean i it's beyond belief inn it
If I wanted somebody to buy what I'd got I'd be scrupulous about that wouldn't you
Well it's the people they employ probably not the people who are who er
Do you do you think
want the business

I said what do you have gates for if not to close them
No point having a gate is there if you don't close it
Well they do it because they're lazy
They want to put their car put they want to drive
No
straight in with their cars
it's deeper than that they don't like what they see
If they don't like what they see they spoil it

Hmm

Well we'll go on the corporation wait for a corporation you wouldn't wait for a corporation I said wait wait for the big bus
I mean if we go we're sitting on the outside and invariably they're a bit over into the gang way well if a chap kept pushing against us as the car went round corners it wouldn't be very nice would it
Some might like it some might object

well oh you're supposed to have four cups I'll er I'll use it one day and not tell you and see if you can tell the difference shall I
Those bricks of
seemed to be holding them from better place from the springs we couldn't find aren't they
what the
you know I used to sort of bel low out
bel low out yes well the the wind the wind the hand will blow the light springs up eventually perhaps I'll put when I've made some true er perhaps I would put six inch pieces in instead of any
oh it's alright er I thought this was a nice bottle but it's a foil bag look
mm
that's it they say in you know what they've done they've left the gate wide open again
oh did they
I'll have I'll have to go out and shut it

or haven't you finished it off yet
no I'm finishing off the bits that are left
mm like every thing else you told me you'd finished it the other day
well I have I'm making adjustments what I mean what I'd finished it I didn't bother to try it cos it didn't work now I found out why it don't work I have to change the rod I've got the rod in the wrong place
mm
so I had to go and put a thread on and put it in it in another place
use your glasses do you want another drink
oh yeah keep coming
no you're not having too much
why
well I don't know whether that man over there is cleaning the windows or whether he's having to look at the double glazing again
probably burglars
well he was there yesterday apparently he's must have a complaint on the double glazing wouldn't be cleaning windows two days would he
wouldn't of thought so it's near enough dry now
do you want it hot or or with dry ginger
er dry ginger would be nice
oh you can have it hot
dry ginger yes
well I'll give you dry ginger this time
Flap jacks don't appear to be cooked and yet they've been in the time they should have I don't know what's happened there you are there's your drink don't knock it over
no
put it that side
so where is your
oh I'll get it it's all muck ed up in it gotta clean the shed next thing
I thought you always kept it in here oh
yeahbut
mm
don't get enough heat from there
it says leave it for ten minutes so I expect it er harden s now
What do you think to the pudding
What
Would you sooner of had a pie
oh no I like pudding pie it's a bit dry in it
not really always have more gravy didn't I didn't think the meat was as good you didn't either and I went to another butcher because I thought it
you had to break it to bits to eat it
no you didn't sh in of beef is like that but
too much sh in on it
don't be silly no I thought it looked better at this other bit this butcher's it looked lean er but er m it wasn't perhaps perhaps I didn't cook it enough yesterday drink your drink
yeah
but I've got some left of that beef so
throw it away then
I'm not going to throw it away it's too expensive to throw away no I'll cook it a bit more and do a do a curry rice or spaghetti
make a meat pie and take it to Cat h 's
why should I take it to Cat h 's
that was when I burnt my arm
come on and put your feet up you've done enough
I'm gonna put me feet up for a few minutes do you want now we've nearly finished
mm
I say I'll put me feet up before we wash up
I'll wash up you sit there
no you needn't
have the birds gone
yes twenty four pigeons it's too many
out there
no no the starling s seem to be pecking away at the top slabs are getting dry so I don't know er you see that man's still up there I wonder what he's doing up there at the side
has he got a ladder
well he wouldn't don't take all that long to put gutter ing up does it unless he's pointing the bricks up he was there all day yesterday
perhaps the
oh I see what you mean
any way that's his problem
oh I yeah
mm
are you going to do any drawing or painting are you fed up with it
no it's I'll go
rest
and get on with me you know the board I made
yes
behind the drawing pins
mm
this this little board there's no room to work here
oh that's why you bought the big board
yeah I know but I
you know where your drawing pins are
I tried it but the paper was stuck down stuck down already
look there's the drawing pins
mm leave them there though
out in this cupboard
mm
I should like something nice to finish off with
take your skirt of then
don't be silly
mm ain't that nice
no
I thought it was
do you want half this orange
I'll have a bit then if you're not gonna eat it
cos the big ones are too big big aren't they these are
how is it that we forbid
how is it that were still
I've only just put it on
oh are they different oranges
no they're M or roc but they're
they are
but they're a bigger size and thicker skinned I'd sooner have the smaller ones
you don't see blood oranges now do ya
you do sometimes these are the best M or roc 's but same the stall I go to doesn't stand on Tuesdays only Wednesdays and Fridays and Saturdays here are
don't get juice all over it
I shan't get juice all over every where it'll be you
Well Made your Barbara's on at two o'clock are you going to see that
mm I might as well
you've got to be quick though
what time now
it's nearly that now are you going to change
mm
mm you better they're your old trousers aren't they
I mean
well with Cl are and
look at all the pigeons again do you want to have a bit more nice aren't they sit up sit up these are juicy aren't they must still be very cold outside can you see the steam from the boiler
mm where was that fog on freezing roads
I'm glad we've got the cook er hood done you can see all that black
mm
can't never that filter to be like that have you
ah I've put you a three eight wide eight thick piece of steel lay it on the top that would hold it down in the middle
well those hack saw blades do don't they
mm just hold it down and
I mean I think so
that spring didn't work the one we had did it cos it
I think those springs are are dangerous they shoot up and down on
came flying out when out in't it when we put it in
mm
now we know
I mean
it won't fly out when it's inside
that's what I mean as you were putting it in it it shot out didn't it
mm
last time
Not much on these potatoes
I've not had any today just had one little bit do do you like 'em
one thin strip of metal edge ways on across the centre I'd do it won't it that thing
would it
well you've got all the size pattern down
well your the expert
in that across
well that that spring you got was too thick
mm
too wide wasn't it it was wider than the the thing itself so you want it's got to be cut down width wise
you know how according to the thick the bull clip last time you had a lot of cause didn't ya
ah but on you know the new dia gram the new packet the springs went like dia er
diamond
half a diamond shape
yeah what you really want is a
and on one side and yet inside the instructions it gave you know
mm
two curves
yes well I've been thinking about it what you want is a
well we paid about three pounds for those springs
springs
mm
when do you ever buy
when we bought them when we had the first lot of springs
oh I we haven't got them now that's before
you must have must be in me diary
well any way look if I made you a thin bit of steel straight across the centre like that
yes that would
it's thicker than hack saw blade perhaps a bit heavier
mm
straight across and then put a cross on the other way that's all you want
mm
like that
mm I know
like hackhack saw blades sort of thing
mm
edge ways on
mm
not flat because you stop the air from to that simple enough
where you going to get the spring from
steel
mm
oh I've got a load of that back of the car
Is this too hot with the fire on
no I'm alright
is that the boiler making that noise
yeah
seems to be louder than usual don't it
or it's your fan
I thought I'd turn the fan on
your fan
I know I thought I'd turned it off I'm going to have a look something seems to be making a noise it was the vent
yeah yeah
I'd put that on as well as the other fan
as the fan the fats congealed with the frost
what on the
you know in the opening and
mm
the fans are catching it
How what's the time now
nearly five too five too
oh
stop moaning you know what you didn't have
that there
your medicine before your meal that medicine you're supposed to take before for your chest
that's alright now it's not er it must of been er congealed in the night in the chest
Tis now
she won't agree
yeah
I the the disturbed at the way the English lads are speaking
ooh without a doubt
in a way they find out
no I think that it's to get the vocabulary various classes of people and varies age group
yeahbut as Les says there's more in it than that
there's a there's of course the entire speaking
is getting very bad now in't it
yes
I brought those all Arthur er m
it's gotta be like that is it
they're the things that's got to fit in no they're not
and now I think do they just clip on they just clip on
yes they weller see that step only there's er m
yes I'll just have to stand up
I reckon there's another one the other side perhaps that they
yes
only just drop on like that don't they
yes and then the piece sticks out where you just er where it goes on
yeah
so I don't how'll you how will you do it will you be alright to do it
yeah is it is this one alright is it is it only the one broken or two
no there's two they're the two pins
they're these are all the bits
yes
well there's only only enough bit then for I don't
yes
that's why I shall come up and have a look at
are yours
don't know
that stuff what's clipped on yours with your pin
no I'll show you in a minute no
or are they just er
here you are lets take these
what I think Les I think you should have two walls I don't know I think you should have two walls one either side
yes ther ther there
then and that
them split at the end
yes
where it's on
er right
see it's split
mind that might be hot
ooh
don't put it on the carpet if it's hot
there it is look
no that
see that spark
don't want sewing up
yes
see were on a bit of a
yes I move that metal that comes out and it's split
yeah well what
is yours split there
no well what
don't stand on it
what I think is this
oh I see yes I see
hold on a minute Les lets turn these off
mind your going to spray
lets move it away
underneath in't it
oh we've got one of them light bulbs
oh things come out
to be replaced look one of 'ems gone that's why it's dark
er used to any way that wants seeing er I reckon you should have see that lip
yes
I reckon you should have another lip and it fits that slide on like that
yes
so you'll I shall have to make one
yes I wonder if er if you got two bits of thin tin you know
yeah well I and er
make you
and er
it just slides on I think
lower that and and you peg stones up like that
that's right yes
see you can't go out cos that's er and er just pushes on I think
yes cos the cos cos where's yeah
you see it's very fragile got a
where it's come off
mm
it's it's parted the the the the metal fang comes along and then when it gets to the end ere it's split it's split
I you know what that's for for the spring it's split like that in't it
what yeah
it's split like that
yes yes the metal yes and it
which is
clips on there I think
well yeah you open that out to make it tight
oh I to fasten it on
yeah
I see
you see you get over the years it probably expands and it
yes
becomes loose
ah
so you open that a bit
yes
that spring
which is that yeah I
and then
alright then
you'll have to push it on
I got it yes
any way I'll make sum mat to do it
right thank you you've got the two pins have ya
yeah yeah
Arthur
Better find a little dish to put them on so you don't wa
well I've got plenty
loose them let me get a dish
I've got plenty of drivers like this
have ya
yeah
here's one here and you've got the other one ain't ya
used to drive er m our machine used to drive
did they
what we call drivers
yes
about two inch long you know
yeah
and er they are very fragile
yeah
they've made it so as it it do you see I I I reckon you ought to open my let me make them in te in steel because er they made them like that so that when you pull them off or adjust them
yes
they won't burn ya
no yes
I mean they're like er ha hard plastic
it is in't it yes it's like it
what are ours
er well metal you see there look
yeah
well you don't you don't have to make it in plastic do you
well it does it its method is to shove them on
oh
er in or out according to where he wants them to flicker well you see as it as the wearing get hot that plastic expands and become loose and he's got a a split see that steel thing
mm
ours is like that solid well his is split the idea that is you opened it like that so when you push your others on it has to com press it and it holds but over the years it's er the body
weak ed
the body
yeah
yeah
er er I can make you one in plastic
what
but er
oh what oh I dunno know er
mm have you had it a few years
ooh yeah about two the same one in the lounge and one in the in the dining room one's got the con vector on
it depends don't it
the top
mm
and the two bars and the other one's got the two bars
mm
yeah they're very good and er funny that one in each has gone
ohoh it's
you see not the two yes so we've still got one lighting on each
my tubes have gone one out of each pack oh I see you've got one one er er out of each room
that's right yes yeah yes
I just remembered one of these lights went last night
did they
I forgot to remind Arthur to er
yes
to replace it
yeah yeah
get that one down
yes without go coming up to say and I presume it's like this you perhaps told when I draw it
don't draw on that table too much you'll mark the table
now that's your piece still I assume
yes coming that way
that way
yes
now this this is the matter now you your other bit I don't think your gonna see it mate
put that other lamp on Arthur
yeah
so you can see
yes
is E a die resting
yes yes she'll just have an or orange when I came out she's been I've been getting a few of those it seems to help a bit
mm I always eat plenty of fruit
yes yeah
Arthur does grapes
does he
mm he loves grapes and apples
er
we couldn't bring any apples though yesterday not taking me car with
ah carrying yes
we get er
how's the arm going Evelyn
well it's it's still swollen
yeah
oh her temper s getting the same Les
yeahyeahyeah
but er I can turn taps and hold things a little bit more
can you yes I well it's gonna take time for that
not not all that
to go down in't it
as you you know how you sort of hold want to
yes
hold things in your left hand
yes
er it's still not very strong
is it
no
mm
but the swelling s gone down mostly I've got gloves
ooh it is it's a lot better yes quite a while
on for the first time yesterday
Christmas yes yeah
so
yes
I think I'll go
you can't draw it in yellow cos it don't er take on this so I'm going
you don't have to draw it in yellow
no no I'll be alright now
if you do them both white it looks all wrong
yeah
but you've got different colour pencils
now this green is your your yellow
yes
er there's a slit there ain't there like that keep this still
yes that's right it's open yeah
well
oh that's how how it works
now that's that's the wall of your yellows
yes
broken
that's right
and that's the other wall which you need to go
yes as far as I can see with the other one's
yeah
still on yes
yeah they now looking at end ways it's like this in't it
yes
that's your your yellow plastic
that's right it's just on the end
that's it now here's your steel bit that's split
yes
like that
yes
so if you open that er steel bit
yes
wide like that
yes
wider than what it is
yes
it grips when you push it on
that's right
and the idea that is is I see it
yeah
is you want
so they will slot it won't they
yeah as I no no not the yellow the the metals slot in
yes
and the idea is so you you push it down to earth you want it down to there
in other words you can move it up and down a ar g h
and I reckon that's it that's broke on your movement you see
yes
it's these walls have broken off there
mm
see those two walls
yes
and that's the bottom bit and that that there's your steel inside
yes that's right
but these have broken off and of course it's dropped off
I
so what I'll shall have to make you is a you can either have it in metal or in plastic
whatever isisis easiest for you Arthur you're doing
well I think it's both easy but er
yeah
there it's done with plastic so it don't get red hot when you when you adjust it
yes
but then again you'd be a bit daft
don't suppose you adjust it very often do ya
no but you'll be a bit
never touched it I haven't
no
you'll be a bit daft to adjust it when it was hot wouldn't ya
mm yeah
yesbut I've never touched them er
if it was mine I'd er I'd er
I've took these off to to put the bulbs in
mm
for my money I'd have it with all metal
yes
but that's the i you see the idea of it now can't ya
yes yes
your yellow bits slides along here to where they were here's your here's your point
yeah
you can have it there you can have it there you can have it there
a hah
by pushing it up and down
yes
and this gets very hot well fairly hot
yes
and the plastic soft and broke
yes I think what I can see of er of what's on the other one on each fire
yeah
er there right on the end
mm oh I see
there right to the end
oh Arthur's all always messing about with ours
is he
to sort of make them go round
ah
you know unless there's a draft
yes
they won't always flicker do they
no no no
he likes fiddling about
yeah
I've made ours go right and left we've got two
yeah I've never touched ours much at all
well he's only got on there's one out of each fire
oh we've got two and er
well so has Les got two
on the same fire
yes
but there's one alright and one broken
there's four altogether
yeahbut oh four well I'd like to
yeah of course yeah
you you see those wings that are going round there
yes yes
he's got two fires
these
yes
I turn 'em what that that way
yeah
and this one that way
yeah
so that one goes to the right and this one goes to the left
ah haha I've nothing never yeah
he he fiddle s about with he likes fiddling
he did tell me though about doing the old pencil in in here in't it
yes
in here Arthur ain't it
or graphite
or a bit of graphite yeah
you put the in there in there do ya
just put your
in there
pencil just put your pencil in and along there
yeah and roll it round I
yeah now here's your there's your peg look your pointer now draw it in black you can see it better there's your pointer now draw it out here the bit you brought your your yellow bit is like that
yes
and if you if I make in steel and then can drive in and fit your pin
yes
you'd have this effect see there's your wall and the that then you pin up the middle like that
ah yes
you see but now that if that were metal and this is your other metal
yes
you know what you say that's split
yes where it's gotta go on
yeah gotta go on like that in't it
yes
now for my money now if that were loose I'd open these
shall
no
strip straight them open so that they're like that a bit instead er
ah yeah
straight like that
yes
and then if you did that it would tighten on to your walls
yes
and you could make adjust it and it'd stay there
ah
but over the years it's got loose and you've probably fiddled and it did broken
ah
I should have them all metal cos ours is all metal as you see
mm
but I'll make you one in two in plastic if you like
yes you want one of them
no no well
whatever
it'll be easier
these are the best then
these get fairly hot
yes
and er you see these get well they're not too hot there
yeah
but there's your wall look er what we done with it there's your wall that goes should run er like that
yes
then you can adjust it in or out
ah I've got it
just to get it in the right
yes
location
yes
you see well to keep it tight
yes
you open those pr on g s
yeah
and of course it's probably been
yes
over tightened or it's
and that's all they were fasten on with that sort of stuff
that's it
mm
just slide off
would you believe it it's
if if you like I make it all in metal
oh yes which ever s you wanna make
well I'll make er I'll make two in metal and two in plastic and then see how you go on
no make two in metal instead
oh that won't take me five minutes to do that it won't
oh I know your five minutes Arthur five hours
ititit be a quick five minutes
usually always
how the birds going oh
I thought you were feeding 'em when
oh I was looking you see
just before you went upstairs for a bath
yeah
you were cos I when Les came I thought you were still feeding them
apparently on these you know you twist them
yes I yes I've never bothered with
you do know that not too much
them I mean er
but if if you twist that that way
yeah
and that the other way
yeah
you get er m one going that way and one going the other
yeah and also they go better as well don't they
well they're nicer you see
they should go better really shouldn't it
mm
if there
have you seen the records Les is oh he's going to feed the birds before seven
I think you'll find there's quite a selection there and they're sort out what you want and that you know and er ooh there's lot of the old ones and every thing and
mm
yeah
well he's busy taping nearly all our old records
is he yeah
well they're easier to put in the tapes
yeah
are
that's right
you you haven't got a tape machine
no no
no
no
well we only bought ours last year
yeah yeah
but as were getting older we find
yes
put a tape in e a without any trouble I can't
that's right no
I can't see to put the needle on properly on the record
no no
Arthur says I scratch them any way
oh
trying to put it on so
ah yeah
so I never bothered with the records
no
but with a tape
yes
just slot them in
yeah
and that's it
no with the er
in fact if I'd known you hadn't got one the one we had before oh know it's not got a tape on though but you've got a record player haven't you yes
yes yes
right I mean the record player that we've got and radio was quite good
yes
but it hadn't got the tape
no
thing
no
and we gave it to the er m school at over Downing Drive
oh yes
for when they were having their sale for their sports and swimming pool or something
oh yeah yeah mm
I mean we had given to us our friends mad on radios
yes yes
and er you know he always wanted the very latest and
that's right yeah
when he got some money
that's right
he he decided to have er m video and every thing and c ass ette
yes
music centre
yeah
so er m he said would you like it
mm
instead of your old record player
ah very good
so er we had it for about four years and then Arthur decide to have one of these last year
yes yeah yeah
It's funny about Ellis having ya I think I think
yes
the re - u n i o n s though wouldn't be the pre - w a r would they
oh I don't know this this Eileen said something about they had one the year previous
yes but for what year
but they didn't when they're having the next one
oh it was of your age though
oh yes oh yes
ohoh
same age as me
oh
yes
because not many of the
you know when your
was you er was you in the hockey team or any thing
no played
no
hockey but was never in a team no
I us there were one or two er
you were in a football team
yes and then there were the er
what other name black Dor a
oh yes oh I know Dor a she used to be in our dancing troop

we had a little dancing troop
I thought perhaps she might come from something like that
yes yes Dor a
she was captain of the hockey team
well that was before she well was she
I didn't know that
oh yes
cos she was a bit young she was more like my young sister age
does she dance
she was for the top of the hockey team and I were for the football
I've got a picture of her somewhere
if you don't feel think there's a fly at the window
yeah yes
will you pull the curtain

yeah
but you've never seen her since
er m
no do you remember that photograph we've got of that dancing troop
what you

Dor a
Often wondered what's some what happened to some of the
in fact her brother er came to work at Oliver's er er

no
I don't know why

Dun Donald
Dun Donald

next to it
next to it
before before Bull er
get out
Robert's Road at the top
that's right
and I was at the bottom
ah well fancy you knowing her
yeah yes and er she but she was a bit younger than me she was more my young sister's age two years younger than me
ah she would be because she was there

Well fancy that
Cos it's all there you know
Er it was really good
Er and it's only half an hour
Was it all about eva cue es
About half an hour you know
Well German evac u eva cue es but it's all condensed so that you got a lot of information
Yes
Not like a drawn out television programme you know
Oh
I'd like to have
And
seen that
people relating stories about how they you know people lived in these la ca they lived in slums really they they quoted L an cash i re
Yes
People lived in slums
And they went out into the country to these evacuated people and they they thought they were in absolute
Heaven
Mm
Mm
It says and when they got there lot of these kids were dirty they had head lice
Oh yes
he said they th they they stunk he said the wa they were in a terrible state
Mm
He said the shoes are falling off their feet
And these people took them in cleaned them up put them in like a bloody sheetand all sorts he said
Yeah
and they really and they all got an allowance from the government
That's right
for these kids you see
And they got the well got them all new clothes
Mm

Mm
And they said and they loved it
Thought they were in heaven
Yeah
Yes
Sa this wo this kid went out having this bloody bath said can we not do this every day
You know he
but a bath was something never seen before you know
Probably had one every year
So he had to wait in the house and er now it's bed time now
So she said I'll show you to your bedroom and there was two sisters and she says you sleep in that bed and you sleep in that bed
Two single beds in the room
Mm mm
She said we can't do that
She says why not
She said we always sleep together
sister and me
Yeah
She said why do you do that
Says well if I wake up in the night and my sister's not there I'll think someone's taken her or she's run away I'll be frightened
And the same applies the other way so we always stick together
Mm
So we can't sleep in separate beds
She said oh we always sleep in separate beds here
We never have two in a bed
She said oh at home we have five in a bed
That's true enough
That was bloody true as well
Yeah it was
By Jiminy
When they lived in two up and two down
So she said and then we got undressed she said and I got in bed in my er my vest and knickers and th and the lady said where's your pyjama s
She said I haven't got any and I don't know anybody else who has
Yes it was an eye - o p e n e r for half these people
Oh
It er you know it was very very good it was
Oh I know
Well I well you can imagine living in these bloody back to back slums
Oh
And going to some like little farm house
Oh yes
Oh I know
Nice lace curtains and open fields and
Mm
Mm
it was just paradise
Must have been
Must have been
Cos they said they di this bloke said I didn't know anything like that existed
No
I thought everywhere was like where I was
That's right
Didn't know anything
Cobbled streets and bloody back yards you see
That's right
And all smoky
Oh I know
Well fo well there was some lads from Liverpool that was evacuated when we were evacuated
Oh
God
They were filthy
Mm
I mean not just filthy i er bodily but they had filthy habits
Mm
They were terrible
And in fact I think they only la they didn't last a week
They were sent
Mm
back
Yeah
I'd like to have seen that
Ooh he was saying tha that that a million not a million old people blind people sick people kids
Yes
were were dispatched in about a day
Yes
Twenty four hours
It's incredible
He said it was a a a tremendous er
Mm
achievement you know
Mm
Mm
to get all these people
Then of course then when they the kids went up didn't know where they were going and the parents didn't know but they found new found freedom because all the bloody kids had gone to the countryside
That's it
mother and father on their own they're going out dancing and er
Mm
and enjoying their r u d d y selves didn't they
And didn't want them back
And then she was going out making money on munitions
Yes
So there's a big in come coming and no kids to feed
Yes
Yeah
And then of course this was all blown when th the raids stopped for a quite a long time all these bloody kids came back
Yes
And they didn't really want them back at that time
Oh I know
I know
They were quite happy where they were you see
Mm
Yeah it's amazing really
Yeah
Aye
That's a it's a really good er video
Then er after that have another I was watching another one then about the er first world war you know
Mm
That was good too
See it just shows you what kind of vis i videos are really for you know
Oh ye er this had got educational video on the thing
Yeah
you know and it comes on
That you se it was it was on here a few times he talks deliberately and rather slow
Mm
you know yo usually a dark haired chap re got like a bit of a Yo York s hire northern accent
Oh I don't know who you mean
Er oh
What was he in

Ah tha them look them look alright them
D'ya know those were reduced from thirty one pounds to fourteen
Were they
Yes
Yeah
Good buy that then
So I thought well i yo in a in a presentation box
Yeah
and everything
It was a good
Er I just think yo er you know you couldn't be bit for that
So while I was there
Couldn't for that could you
Well yo you know when I looked round Gordon there was nothing nothing less than that really
And I thought well it's for an engagement present just sort of two
Yesit's ideal
it's er ideal and they like wine so
Yeah
I thought it would be er ideal
They had quite a lot of sa er glass ware er m on er half price
Or le more than half price really
Less than half price I should say
That's good
So while I was there I went to have a look at the er m the microwaves for Carl
Oh yes
And er he was very helpful in Rack hams
He really was
Er man bu and he knew his stuff as well
And he and he said really he sa he said have you got one
So I said yes I we I explained why I wa I was asking the question I said it was for my son and er I said but mine's just a a microwave I sa and he said well he said they re the combination ones now he said are really you know what you need
He so I said well I don't know much about the combination
So he said well they have a grill at the top he says so if you're cooking a chicken instead of it coming out pale th the grill will come on and it will brown it
Oh I see
and it's got a but it's been cooked by the microwave you know
Yeah
And a and also I mean it was and it was a Panasonic one thise rm what you do if you were doing a jacket top potato you er would weigh the potato and and then er m put in the weight say it was six ounces and all you do then is press er m jacket potato you don't have to put any time it automatically does it for the time
And that er that's what it is on the thing jacket potato on there
Oh yes
Yes
M hm
You know
It was really it was very good
Now how much wa he's written it down I've got some catalogue s as well
And there was
And you can buy now which I didn't know er ma microwave which is a conventional oven as well
You know
Oh aye
so you can do away with an with your big ovens
Oh yeah
It's got a grilling so you can grill your er steak and so forth your microwave and era fan assisted oven all in one
That's what you need like at the top for your er
That's right
To stand it on
Yesbut yo
Er the hob

Yes
I'm thinking if you've got one of these built in things you could
That's right
Yes
Yeah
But as I say I we I went there and I got all the information there and then I went into Dixon s and I I did what they did on the television you know started talking and so I said well er you know do you have the er ha I noticed that there was er m no finance er
Mm
you know interest
So he said oh no that's only on the Sharp and on washing machines
So I said well how about anything off for cash
So they said no er me rm if you can beat that price we will pay you the difference
So I said oh
So he said er m but we ha being refurbish ed in four weeks' time and we've got to sell everything in the shop
Mm
and he said you will then get it cheaper
He said er is your son desperate for it
So I said no he don't get married for six weeks
So he said well he said tell him to come in in about four weeks time he said we'll be getting rid of everything
Mm
So you know but they hadn't got the selection that Rack hams had

No
Be good actually if he does sleep in the bed cos then we can go in the summer

You just let me try it out
Well I'm just saying see th it's a shame you can't get something you know to prop up to like an L - s h a p e d piece of wood
I know
What d'ya call it
To slip under the bed
has them
Carole 's got a sa a bed thing
You know that you clip on to the side of your bed to stop them rolling out
Really
Carole 's got one
She said I can have it
Really
You just reminded me
Sue had one I think
Mm
Yeah
It's just
for er
like a it's just like a a piece of mesh int it
That's right yeah
At the sides it clips on the side
It just means if they do roll towards the edge it stops
Yeah
the I mean they can get over it and they can get
Yeah
round it that way and that way but it just stops them in their sleep
There's something there
Yeah
Yeah
I'll ask her
Yeah
Remind me to to ask
Yeah
Hopefully I'll get by then
Mm mm
So what will you will you sleep with mother then
I don't know
Oh God mother
U r g h
Wu r g h
Did you watch that on Han ratty
Yeah
Yeah it was good
It was good
I know what i i I suppose it is a good case though
And close to the end a few people that were hanged a are innocent
But I think if you did bring back hanging it'd cut out some of these flaming crimes
I do as well
You know I mean for all the
Well there should be some
if
degrees of it shouldn't there
I mean if if it means that th th there's less there's less people murdered or whatever then I know it sounds easy to
Yeah but if you're one of the innocent ones
I know I said that to Kevin if you're part of the family
Yeah
of the innocent
It's
one
very difficult
It was funny case though Han ratty weren't it
Because sh I mean she was a eye witness and she picked him out
I know but she picked the wrong one out at first
At first
So
yesbut er you can understand the confusion really
I don't know really
I have very mixed feelings about it
But the whole the whole case was ridiculous
I think he was up er I mean that Alf on s Al
Alf on so
Alf on so I think he was the guilty one really
Aha
I do
But like in the statement she said he was er m a original statement she said he was approximately thirty years of age
Yeah
I know
And then it was changed to twenty five
Mm
Mm
Things like that
The battle for him though has been going on for years ain't it Gordon
I think it's sad that I mean even now his name was cleared and e his parents
It's no good
wouldn't know and he wouldn't know and
Mm
It's too
Yeah
far too late int it
Yeah
Well his brothers are still alive
Well yes
But I don't know really
It's er m difficult to say
Mm mm
I thought it was good
But
Is that on every week something like that
Or is
No
that a one - o f f
No
They'd obviously
It's a one - o f f
that was just one - o f f
That was just one - o f f
Well there's murders
I don't know
a on on on a on a Monday night now it's a True Crimes that have never been solved
Er with Edward Woodward or something
Yes
Well this week it's Freddie Mills
Now he was a very well known boxer when we were young in our teen s weren't we Gordon
Mm
And he was the first er really er boxer who became a celebrity
You know like Henry Cooper is
Yeah
now
Well he mixed with all the stars and of course I suppose part of the underworld but er they reckon that he didn't kill himself I mean they did bring it in as suicide but er they reckon that you know there's people think he was murdered
Oh I see so

That's right
It's a hoo li g an 's game played by gentlemen
Yeah
And football's a gentlemen's game played hoo hooligans
Hooligans
Ah
They say about watching as well
Ah
Ah
Don't you smack your Pop se y
Er er they never you know when you watch it on television there's never trouble in rug by like they do in football is there
Well i in rug by when there's trouble it's face to face say what you wanna say and smack them
In football it's wait till the ball's gone then kick them from behind
Ye cha
It's all bloody
it's a bit more child
It is isn't it
it's silly li
Hello
little school girls play football
Mm
Rug by league 's the harder game of the three
Is it
Yeah
It's no use trying to s m arm me
I could watch a game of rug by I couldn't watch
A biscuit
a game of football
No
Yeah
I wonder what is what is the basic difference between rug by league
Not me
and rug by union then
Rug by union players have got a brain
Just there
Yeah
Rug by league players are thick
Is it for me
Stupid
What do you play
What do I
Mummy
I knew she was gonna say which do you
Mummy
play
Rug by union I play
Well rug by league is a is a is there
Basically
more things you can
rug by league players get paid for playing rug by
Fresh orange
It's a job
Yeah
Er that's what you see on a Saturday
What
afternoon are things like rug by league challenge cup final or something
Yeah
Sal ford Saint He lens
Yeah
Wig an Wid nes they play rug by league
You get paid for playing er you don't ha or you have very few scores you don't have line - o u t s and basically you tackle about a hundred million times a game
So basically you just run at them all the time
Fresh orange
I see
So the rules are a bit different then
Oh yeah they are quite significantly different
But I know a lad that's physio for Wig an
Okay darling
Wig an rug by league they do a very good physio now and he was saying when he was Lei g h he was with Lei g h rug by league first of all they had players in their second team and it was their sole intention
to go out and break people's jaws
It's the only way to do it in a game
They don't care if you get
Here are darling
sent off for it
As I say
Ta
absolutely stupid
Good boy
Mm mm
Th the only ones are ed educated are the ones that go from rug by union to rug by league
The rest of them are absolutely stupid
Ye they're all the miners the steel workers the c le a th the
Can you put
road cleaners
have you is he got
Yeah
you
They're not proper people
No
No
They're not
They're absolutely
I'm sure they'll be pleased to hear him say that
And all the all they are er they constantly get done up for beating people up in pub s
Mm
They're just di c er er aggressive
Aggressive people are they
Very fit very aggressive
Dickheads
Basically
Yeah
Mm
Yeah
And you can see when they when they s po when they talk to them after the game
They just they can't construct a sentence
It's like their con t r ast mu contracts must be amazing
Most probably X s
Thick headed
just X s at the bottom of the contract
They can't write
Crazy
But they do they get paid a lot of money but only for a short period of time
Yeah
And because they get paid a lot of money they'll put a lot more into it
I mean there's people my size that are probably faster than our fastest bloke at the club
Our club
Yeah
They're very very fi fast
Mm
El lo ry Han ley 's a rug by player
Have you heard of him
No
He's probably of a rug by league player that is
Aye
I like watching rug by league
I'd hate to play it but I like watching it
Aye
Yeah
Oh
But most of them are on television the rug by league then are they
The only ones you see on unless you watch on Sunday afternoon like I watched last Sunday that's rug by union
Mm mm
On a Saturday afternoon is invariably rug by league yeah

You know it's
Terrible condition that lawn
I can't stand ours
It has it's got worse
No grass on ours
over the years
The more I put into it the worse it goes
I think it does d'ya I think like when you scar if y it and things like that all you do is produce open ground for weeds to grow in
Well no you have to scar if y it and then you have to you have to carry on the work you can't sort of do it and then think ooh I'll leave it for a couple of months

Immediately
Yet she's here all day tomorrow
I mean you know it would have lasted
Yeah

tomorrow
Oh no

I said they're just coming down the road I said the first thing your father'll say has it got a plug on it
Yeah
Cos that's the first thing
Yeah
Funny enough it hadn't got a plug on it
It hadn't
No
Well they should have shouldn't they now
Well I I thought that
I said to Lyndsey I'm sure they're supposed to have plugs on
I don't think it comes into force till nineteen ninety three
Ah
Yeah
Well it's bad
They
Yes
should have them on
Yes
Definitely
Yeah
Yeah
But Lyndsey was saying her answer machine Oh
Excuse me
That's the tea
Her answer machine er she's got two answer machines cos she so when the other wo she kept having a lot of trouble with it kept breaking down and it'd go away for three weeks and she'd be without it
Yeah
so she's got two I think now
And she said the plug that goes into the from the answer machine goes into the thing
Yeah
she said er it went the plug went wrong
So she can't take the plug off
Tt
Oh
You cannot take the plug off at all
No they're mould ed on aren't they
So she's gotta take she took it back she took it back
She said if I send it back it's gonna be nineteen pa it's seven pound to get a thing back
Cor
I said you know they're making things expensive for people
Yes
You know
Yeah
I means even pound and all it is a plug that's wrong
Yes
Yeah
It's disgraceful
It was I'll tell you what it was it was no the plug was alright sorry
It was the wire
Yeah
had come a bit loose
Yes
so all it needed was the plug un doing
Yeah
and the lead to go in you know
Putting through
whatever
Seven pounds it was
It's terrible
Awful int it
It's outrageous what they charge
You know for people on low in comes how can they cope with
No
things like that
They can't
I means even pounds to have I mean they're not gonna probably have an answer machine but you know for things if things are going to be like that
Yeah
how the hell can they afford it
I know
It's terrible
You know
It really is
You don't take sugar do you

Course they do
bloom ing horrible
I think a lot more these days and a lot that you don't know that's wearing contact lenses
That's right
Yeah
I must listen to this
Again
Yeah but he said you know is that your mum there

Just on the other side
Well should have been really taking two of her strong tab lets she says you know and she has
Oh dear

On that side
Yeah
It sounds like a
Oh dear
She went to see chiropractor s you know when

Oh heck
And that is bad news
What did she mention anything about the card
No I didn't
And didn't you
No
I'm not having it er she didn't do the when she said to me I want to speak to you about it she said you know she wasn't involving me at all was she
No
I'm thinking of writing myself you know to Karen
Oh no you can't do that
I I can
Because I don't mind if Karen writes and bloody blames us that it's our bloody fault I'm not bothered
No I just feel that er
You don't wanna do that
I mean we
It'll upset her that
she's obviously er very upset and I I mean I just don't want that she's such a nice girl
You know like I really don't I I just thought perhaps a note from me you know apologizing
Why not get a note from Karen apologizing for being a I had the hump
Yeah
I thought well a note from both of us really
Well I don't think she and she Karen wouldn't want that because well it it's nothing to do with us
Is it
We're sticking our er oar in where we shouldn't
And so the other he's there if you want isn't he
I mean
Well I know that
You can't stick your oar in like that to her at any old time can you really
No
Well you could have stuck you know seven or eight years of age you couldn't even do it then in case it hurt the kid's mother or something like that or whatever it was
She's nearly an adult
Well and truly
Getting an old man now never mind
Well I know that
I know but
Well it's it's not our it's not our er we'll be just sticking our nose in where it's not necessarily wanted
Yes but it was our mistake in the first place
Well it wasn't really was it
Obviously I mean I know you're arguing with her but er but if he'd if he'd have go if we got a christian name that night it wouldn't have gone down as either of those Karen or Fran
I know well we could have found out quite easily
Oh aye
That's a different story
Yes
We could have found out
We could have phoned A my and found out there and then virtually but I think we said oh Is umm at like i i it's not worth bothering about don't matter just put
But it did matter didn't it
It did matter but we didn't know that at the time did we
Oh no we didn't
It'll be worse now in re t ro spec t it'll worse phoning A my up at that moment and asking what the name was
And he could have put it down while he was here
Cos he didn't know the name that night
Oh I know he didn't
I know that
But the thing was what I what I was ge getting to last night is that we didn't bring the name into it the su rna me

She said I don't believe this
She said a ee and d'ya know what I didn't have a student
The students
Didn't you
That's daddy's car

Do you know I've just realized that your curtains are nearly like what I've ordered for the bedroom

Cos it's not long now you know Rosie

Oh do you think our Carl will survive
I'm getting a bit worried well I'm getting worried myself but I don't know I think he might be a bit nervous
He's ve he's very edgy
Yeah
I think
He is as well
Mm
And I think he's lost weight but I don't like to tell
I do
him
I do
I don't know whether he's told you cos I think he has
Yes
Mm mm
Yes I do too
But you know Rosie he does silly things I mean er m
I know that
he comes home at at nine o'clock and he he doesn't have a thing to eat and he goes out playing squash then he's not eating his main meal till eleven o'clock at night
No I know
Which is stupid
I've told him yeah
I'm glad you have because he won't take any notice of me
He hasn't anything to eat time to eat anything
No
No I'm sure that he doesn't
I know
There we are Rosie
He takes a a
properly
sandwich you see and eat it while he's er m
Oh my goodness
while he's while he's working d'ya know
Well I think he ought to do something

But there's always somebody wanting him you know at that shop
They always seem to er m

Yes
No Gordon they're in the side cupboard there
Oh
That'll do
In the side cupboard love
Yeah
Yeah
He doesn't get a lot of peace
There's always somebody
I'm sure
either on the phone or in the shop you know
Mm mm
I know it's er oh I know I think he works very hard indeed he just sort of
He does
worries me that he really can't carry on like that
No
And I don't know er what the solution
No
is
Well it'll perhaps improve when he doesn't have so far to go won't it
Mm mm
you know
Er
That'll help a great deal
I think I don't know if I'm finding it quite difficult at the moment because he he's sort of neither one thing nor the other and we're out a lot sort of
Yes
doing things er and then we're both going home and I don't know it is awkward int it
It is
It's quite stressful really
I'm sure it is Rosie

Yes she's me she's better now than what she was er Rosie thanks
I think that sickly feeling
Mm
has gone
Oh good
I think it's just a problem what she's going to wear for your
wedding
Mm
I think you'd better mention something to Rosie love about that er
Oh oh yes Rosie
an apology about that letter
we have been most upset Gordon and I about
Oh
this letter you received off my sister
Oh
That's alright
Doesn't matter
It's because we're at logger heads Rosie
Well I gathered there was some problem
Eh er i no I really don't know what I've done
I er m
No
I phoned her er whe whe when was it Gordon
Ma in the middle of last year wasn't it
I didn't
Yeah
receive not this Christmas but the Christmas before Rosie I didn't receive a Christmas card from her
Mm
which is most unusual
Mm mm
and I er mmy brother didn't and we said well there must be something wrong
Yeah
Yeah
So I left it for a while and I thought I will phone her and find out
And when I got through I knew immediately by the tone of her voice that she was there was something wrong
So I said I asked her what was the matter and she said well I feel as though er that you've er you and Arthur have ignored me
I said but we haven't
You know and er she said well I feel as though you have
And she was going on
So I said oh well I said er if you we really want to get the nitty - g r i t t i e s I said you know we didn't receive a Christmas card from you I said but we sent them to you
So she said er no I know you didn't she said because I didn't send you one
So I said oh I said well you know if that's how you feel I said but I will tell you I said I'm now a grandma and I said and er Carl is getting married to Rosie
Mm
And so she said oh right
And I knew that was the end of the conversation
Oh
So I I thought well we will send her a card then she's got er and invitation
Oh yeah
so then she's not going to she's not got anything to moan about
Yeah
But I thought the reply was abs I thought it was utterly disgraceful
And she's done it to spite me Rosie
And I apologize
I didn't I didn't take a lot of notice really
I mean what er what she put was that o okay wasn't it
I know but the paper Rosie
And no address
Just a
on it
note pad with all holes in the top
Well never mind
Never mind
But I I really do apologize about it but she has done it er m
Well it's not not your fault is it you know
I feel to sa to spite me
Mm
Ooh
I was most upset when I saw it
Yes
Well never mind anyway
It doesn't matter at all
But Carl had said there was some problems there
Mm
or something
Er m
She's she's most
But
peculiar
Is she younger or older
Oh no she's older
Oh
She's the eldest of the family
Perhaps
And
perhaps sh shouldn't suggest these things but perhaps she's going a bit off it or something
I don't know really
Er m you see when my other sister died Ada I mean Arthur and I we did all the organization didn't we Gordon
Mm
I mean and we were going down every day to see her when she was
Yeah
poorly
Now she came at the bitter end and she never did anything
No
You know and then she starts moaning
Mm
This is the trouble with families int it
You get you get
I'm afraid it is
all these things and
Mm
yeah I don't know
It's very difficult sometimes
My mum er doesn't know in fact he's not replied yet Uncle Stan he's her youngest brother
M hm
and he's a lovely person he's full of fun and everything but he he's one of these he always says he's coming and never comes
Yes
So they live near Hull
And er m er when Aunt Aunt y May you know is blind my mum's sister
Mm mm
and he's always saying he's going to see her and he never does
And er he just he said he was coming to er m my Uncle Les ' funeral but he never turned up
No
And so I'll be very surprised if he comes
Yes
But there's nothing wrong there between us but
No
he's just like
Yeah
that you see
Well you see er m I mean when when Gordon and I got married er my sister's husband didn't come to the wedding until later on did he Gordon
Because
No
he was he wouldn't give up his Saturday work you see
Oh
He's er most peculiar
Now when Elaine
Yeah

And I'd just got in at about oh half three
Ooh
And it the heavens opened

It just went at like slow motion
Lying on the table it was
Fortunately on the table and the co v that cover was on

It's with
I put
it going over you see
Mm

No
Where if they would have grown bigger the er mit would have balanced it
Mm
Anyhow it's alright now
And I put extra compost in and but it's er m I know it's still very er dodgy
I think perhaps when they open up fully the flowers it'll er perhaps balance a bit better
Yeah
Oh dear

Or eat some of it otherwise you'll get an air lock won't you
I mean there's another hour

Our Carl wanted to know what why you were going
Did he
Yeah
What did he say
He said oh he said what are they celebrating
I said nothing
Well he said well it seems funny they're going out doesn't it
Well I said well as far as I know I said nothing they're not celebrating anything
Should have said to him you never take dad out for a curry so Kevin's going
Tt
Oh Gordon
He has taken you out
Yeah about four years ago
You're very ungrateful
Well he's taken us out when they've been to bloody shop working and come back and wa I admitted that but I mean just to go out for an evening
I mean he never says to me go and have a do you wanna go for a pint or wanna go for a curry or ow t does he
No
Well we don't see him much now do we
Well I'm not I'm not bothered about it
It doesn't worry me
Well who wants to go out with a dodd er y old bugger like me anyway
Surprised Kevin wants to surprised Kevin wants to go
Well it's
Could go on to the rug by and go with them couldn't he
Well
Eh
yeah
Instead of a dodd e ring old bugger like who's miserable
Well well he hasn't got a father so he regards you doesn't he
If you wanna take it that way
If if Labour say get in
if Labour get in and they can't f ulf il their promises
Yes
like John Smith's made promises then that Conservatives haven't done this that and the other he must be able to do them now mustn't he
Who must
John Smith
Well er m they they don't know whether they can do it or not do they
No but he's criticizing the Conservative policies and all that and what we will do is this
I know for investment
Yes but they all say that
industry
don't they until they get into power
I know
And the and then they all
They do
Back down
They do
Yeah
They'll say they they probably haven't got the finances to back up what they what they said they would do
Yeah but a lo a lot of quotes gonna be made to them after aren't there
You know like you said this and you haven't done it you said that and you haven't done it and all that sort of
Yes but once they're in power there's nothing you
Well
can do about it
oh admittedly no
No
But they must feel a bit stupid to er
Well I can't well I mean there's an awful lot I mean would no no matter which political party it is they all make promises but they don't carry them all out
No
Course not
But I mean these are these are major things
Getting the economy right
Now John Smith
But er well John may have
we'll get the economy right
Now if he doesn't get the economy right he's gonna end up with egg on his face and
Of course he is
But you tell me how just how is he going to do it
I mean ee they don't explain to you how they're going to do it do they
No
They they just come out wi a er
With statements
glib ly with these these statements
Mm
Mm
I'm sure that e e if there is an easy way of doing it the Conservatives would have found out and done it
I don't think there's any any easy way
I don't see how they're going to do it
No
I really don't
I mean where are they going where are they going to get the extra money from er to pay for the old aged pensioners ' er eight pound rise
Mm
Or so they say we'll get eight pound
Somebody's got to pay for it
So it'll be the working people er probably the the national er health stamp 'll have to go go up
It'll be a sorry day if they get in
It will Gordon
Oh
I don't know
You're a real turn coat you are
Mm
Aren't you
Mm
I was listening today to er m a man on the radio and he was only thirty four and he had a stroke and they were saying he they er they were asking him they said well how did it happen
They said did you have any warning
And he said no
None at all he said
I was gardening and he said er er I bent over to do something and he said I just went dizzy he said and I fell over he said and then I realized my right side was paralysed
And he said I was completely confused and I couldn't he said I was trying to shout my wife and er m and er you know my mouth wouldn't work he said but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital
And they were saying they were saying that you know you associate strokes with older people but there's a hundred young people a week have strokes
Tt
Aye
And he said er m like it's the c lots to your brains that er m that cause it you know
They said well did you have any warning about it
And he said er no he said I didn't think I had he said but now he said I realized that how I was forgetting er I'd be talking and I'd forget sort of what I was just talking about that split second
Mm
And now the stroke has affected him that way
He can be talking say about a well you know about any er about sa say a a video recorder or something like that
Mm
and for a minute he can forget that he's talking about it
Mm
You know but er m he sa he's recovered reasonably well in the same you know but
Got his use
very
back
er partly back
Partly back
Not fully
You know
Thirty four
I know
I mean you just don't you don't imagine that do you really
No
It's terrible
But a hundred young people a week
I mean I I couldn't believe it when they were saying that
That's terrible
It is
It's an awful thing
See I've never I've never across anyone that like know you
What do you mean
Well I've known anyone to be five years and no use whatsoever
Ah well and A un I mean Aunt y Lilly was like that Gordon
She never got her use back and she never spoke again
Yeah but she didn't well she didn't live long after her stroke did she
Oh she did you know
Er not as
Mind she was in bed all the time
Oh she was in bed all the time
Yes
How long did she live after the stroke
Only months weren't it
Oh no
Oh no
It wasn't months Gordon
No
I mean she was in Park Hospital for so long and then she was transferred to a nursing home in Thornton
Er do yo don't you remember us ta taking Iris and I an down to see her
I didn't see her did I
No we didn't go in but Iris and I an did
Did he
Yes
Well I I we I I drove them there
You was with me
Yeah
Yes
Well I reckon she lived er a couple of years after the stroke Gordon
I mean and she was in a terrible I mean she couldn't even speak
No
I meaner er m and I went to see her in Park Hospital and she was very f rust rat very frustrated because she couldn't speak
No
What was she doing in Park Hospital
She took ill at Aunt y Edith 's
Well was it Edith 's
Yeah
I th I think they'd been on holiday and she took ill on the holiday and and came er m she was stopping at er m Edith 's and er it happened then
Well you know I can't recall any of this
Yes
Did we we go to Edith 's to see her then did we not
No but I went to Park Hospital to see her
Because Edith now Edith was going away for some unknown reason I don't know she must have been going on another holiday anyhow
No she was in Park Hospital a long time
That was it because Edith was going on another holiday and she was er she wanted someone to go and visit er Lilly and I said well I'll go
And I I it was when I had my own car and I drove there
And I wanted to see her
She was very very frustrated cos she couldn't speak
Mm
And she couldn't write anything down
I don't think you saw her actually
I don't think I did
I never recall seeing her when she was ill
Never
No
No
Well you must have been going during the day while I was at work then
No it was night time I went cos I was working
Well why in the bloody hell I didn't go then
Why didn't I go with you
I don't know
Was it night school or something like that or what
I don't know
I think you we d'ya know I think you were at night school Gordon when I think about it
I think you were teaching at night school
It must have been something I was doing
No
I know why Gordon
Because the ba the children were small
Yo one of us had to stay in
Oh yes
Aye that's right
Of course yes
You know I mean they were only small
Aye that's right
Did we live in Ashton Lane then
Er m no we were here
Were we
Yes
Well I didn't have my own car in Ashton Lane
No you didn't
That's right
So we was here
Well about nineteen seventy then seventy one
No you got your licence in er m was it it were early in the year when you passed your test
Yes I think it was
Well it were seventy one
Mm
Cos didn't you phone me at Lilly cups to tell me
Yes I think I did
Yes
Yes
Well I was only at Lilly cups from August seventy till August seventy one
Yes
Only a year
And if you phoned me early in the year it must have been just after we got the V W.
Yes
I think it was
Just a couple
So
of months after we got that
I think it was because er th cos we'd got Iris ' er er Triumph didn't we
That's right
Yes
Soon after that
Yes
I think we did Gordon
And you were driving that about
That's right
That's right
Well Carl hadn't passed
And you went you went in that Triumph did you to the
I did
Yes
Well it's ser te it was later than seventy one you see
Mm
And you had that car about two years didn't you
Oh yes
Perhaps a bit longer
Two years
Yeah
Because I came I came to er Dell as el
Yeah
when Carl passed his er to M G S.
Yeah
Do you remember
Yeah
B limey
Do you mean must be about twenty years ago then
Yes
Yeah about twenty
This is why you know I I think you should keep di I keep diaries from years ago because I know you don't like nostalgia and I don't but it's interesting
Mm mm
to look up
Yes
Er events
Yes
I mean I've got no diaries dating back that long
No I know
Well I haven't
I have no record of anything
No
happening then
No
But just one line of things that you know I don't mean a diary where you write a page every night but just two lines you know
Yeah
All and what you did and when I got the car the date and when you got that Triumph then
Yeah
You know little just a line
And then when you look at it er ca you can recall then
Oh yes
other things
That's right
The one line sort of sets it all off you can remember
That's right
Yeah
Mm
Yes but I remember I can remember Edith phoning me and and saying you know she was going away you know is you know could I go down
And I said yes
Mm
I cos I remember coming coming back I got lost
You know where er that circle is where there's the shops well instead of taking I know instead of taking one road I took another and I got completely lost
Mm
Mm
I wouldn't now but then I I I didn't know er round that are a
No that's right really I mean if you don't know the are a you don't know which road to take on the islands
I know
But I mean you wouldn't have thought that Ed er Lilly I mean she had no weight on her or anything like
No
that did she
No
She's always been active all her life
All been active all her life
No you can't understand how these things happen
Well they give you all these bloody tips and papers about what to do to avoid this and avoid that
And what to eat and everything but
This bloody football er I mean it's a
I know
a really fit man
I know
He's er one artery was seventy percent blocked it was in the paper
Yeah
And the other artery was ninety percent blocked
Was it really
Yeah
Yeah
Good God
I mean he could have gone an any time
Graham Soun ness I mean he's only thirty eight
Could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody arteries
Good God
But that's in c red I didn't know it was that bad
It was in the paper this morning
And er
Goodness me
Well he's a he he didn't smoke
No
He was an athlete
He's been an athlete
He obviously ate like everybody else
Mm
And he
I mean
wasn't overweight in any way
Wasn't overweight what more
No
the bloody hell do you have to do
That's incredible that
See they say it was a ma it's hereditary
Well
Cos his father had a bypass didn't he
Oh did he
I think some other relative died er
Oh
youngish
Yes
Oh well I bet I think perhaps it is really
I know
It's still going
I know
Yeah and you can't you can't understand it can you really
Well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one
That's right yeah
Yeah
And she does all her own shopping
Mm
You know I mean she keeps stopping but she'sshe's remarkable
She really is
Mm
But they're few and far between aren't they
When th you're like that
Yeah
Mm
But what I couldn't understand with this Soun this fella that
This Soun ness
Aye
He he found out cos he went for to for a check up and they took his blood pressure
Yes
And tha well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken they find it's high and they
Yes
give them tab lets
Yes
Go home
Why did they take it a stage further with him
He'd got high blood pressure he wasn't in any pain he's living a normal life
Similar to what I was when I went
Yes
And they just give me tab lets
Yes
Now why what made them take it to the stage
Well er well first
where he wanted a heart bypass
first and foremost he was in a private scheme
Well pro probably that's it then
Yeah
A and probably because i because of his father and er the re la the other relative having the by passes done
So they took it
Mm
a step further but I think probably it's because he was in er er a private scheme
Very likely inn it
Yes
So there's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tab lets who probably really should have a by bypass
Ah well I well I wouldn't say that really Gordon
I mean I think er when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tab lets ever so I think it's kept it all under control and you've you we eat a sensible diet
The only the only er thing I complained about with you is is the butter
Mm
I don't have that much now
But I think everything in moderation but you don't eat as much butter now as what you used to
I don't eat that much bread you see
No
So I I think really and I think what I think with him I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family it runs in the family
Mm mm
Must be hell of a shock being told
Oh God
It must have been
See how much it's costing
Two hundred and fifty pounds a night
Yeah
P h w or g h
That's without the operation
Yeah
Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then
Oh I know
And plus he's he he he he married an heiress you know
Did he
Er him er sh they live in Spain now
Oh er he he's worth a pretty penny is Soun ness
He went in Carl's shop the other the other week
Did he
Yes

Yeah
Some time today
Aye
I tell you what that's quick int it though Gordon
With only going in last night and
Mm

We I wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he wouldn't have been in a private scheme
He could wait six months couldn't he
Well he could have been dead by then
Well er yea he exactly that's what they're moaning about int it
Terrible
Put them on a list and wait
I've never heard so much talk about health as we do nowadays
Oh I know
When I was young I co I don't remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you shouldn't do
No I know
Did you
No
But we weren't educated in in in health though
We just li we just lived and that was the end of it
Yes but then you see in the ol in the old days GordonI mean you we you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day and i and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all
Now we're much more affluent and people are educated we er
Mm
as regards their health
M hm
Well th having said that Gordon your mother lived to a good old age and my mum and my father did
Yeah
And they ate all the wrong stuff didn't they
According to wha according to what they say now they did

I know
Don't know who to believe really
When you look at when you look at the some all these a lot of these composers and artists who died long ago and you look the birth range there's a hell of a lot at seventy five seventy six

But there's a hell of a lot well into their seventies
You know and they were born early eighteen hundreds
Yes
Yes

True
I was gonna say I didn't think it was your type of music

Inn it
But I can stand this better than that one
Yeah
Why what is your type
Motown
of music
Status Quo Genesis Fleet wood Mac and a bit of Motown on there
Some as well actually
Mm
You get used to it
Mm
Better than Thursday night when Mick 's doing it when he's doing the er sort of thrash metal for
Mm
an hour and half solid
Yeah
A bit heavy going
I sound like I sound like my mum and dad though when I'm criticizing it you know
All sounds the same it's just a noise and you know you can't th the words
Well you
You sound like your mum and dad criticizing the music you know
Sixties and seventies
Ninety per ce ninety percent of records in charts today there's no words anyway are they
Mm
It's all music
No that's right
So anyway it's not even that is it
It's all computerized today
Yeah
so er
Mm
electrical effects and
Do that bloody wanna tape on
Well you are we can get Dawn 's brother if you want
Well if I knew who the hell Dawn 's brother was
Well I'll take him to see

My hero
Shut up

Ooh
Jean's in next week yeah
Big city job
Oh yeah yeah
Bet you fucking lay down the law alright
See she sounds like a wimp though
My anguish my life's shattered sort of thing
God
The last thing I'd do when I get Mr
Especially when
Yeah
Yeah
It's a is it in and he's just saying that the develop re development starts in autumn
Yeah
I mean I
Sum mat in autumn
I think it's I think that's er m well it's not exactly a bluff but it's it's a case of er what they hope will hap p hope will happen
Er I don't think are pulling out but they they've suspended things but I mean they just don't know if they're competing
They just the politics
Yeah
I mean they can't possibly er m you know cos they
Mm
can't you can't accuse just Jean of corruption they've got to they've got to accuse the development corporation of corruption as well
You know cos you can't be corrupt just on one person you've gotta have two people playing
Oh aye
but you know
So th to a you know and as said you know we er m we don't need to bribe anybody to come into More cam be
Right
You know nobody else would come in
No that's it
You know that's just my point you know
Nobody wants to come here and spend money do they
No
Oh well
It just I think it I think it affected us last week so er m cos the the Friday night was well down
Mm
It was only only about ninety people two hundred people Friday
I think it was over speculate d in the press that we've sold the premises and it it well gave the impression that perhaps we might be open you know some people might not think we're open even
Well that's what what I said on Saturday
Yeah
they didn't think they'd be open you know
Yeah
When they come for tea you know
Mm
on Friday thought they were closed
Yeah
Mm
And if you're coming through from Lancaster you know as soon a it's a far old drag inn it
After the pub s are closed on the off - c h a n c e I mean cos if you get here what the hell do you do if not as if you've got an alternative is there
No
You know
If yo if you're gonna come here yo you're the ki not on a Saturday night you're not the kind of clientele that's gonna go to the Empire
Oh no
Prince 's Tea Rooms and so you gotta traipse all the way back into Lancaster to go
Mm
to The Alley
Yeah
What like putting a bus on which shows you that you was open like you know
Mm
put a bus on on a Wednesday night
Yeahthat's right
So How do
Oh
Hello Mark
Hi
It must be cold it's bloody coming off you
Bloody freezing out there
Oh well

I just wonder sometimes when Terri turns things on
It is very cold
Last last time she put the ventilation on instead
Can you just hang about here I'll just go and check
Okay
Bet it's blasting cold air out for an hour
Anyway sod though Mark
What about it
Well you're a w or you're a bloom ing big girl
You can't stand the cold
Cor
It's the blasting the heat out in there Mark
I don't know
Is it though
Yes
Oh it's
It's p he w
What a scorch er
There's people up there in their underpants
Well I wanna see the people that
It's nothing to do with the climate
Am I right in in thinking that we're having some new speakers
Yes
Why
Well what we're doing is putting the er m ha
We're putting the the t annoy system back in
Right
Into operation
and everything's back out again
Yeah
and it's
Right
Well you know the o o ga my flip 's du in there
Four speakers around the dance floor and er two big bass things
Mm
Mick 's gonna getting those together and
Yeah I know
Cos they they kept blowing before though didn't they those
If I remember rightly
Well yeah
Did they
Yeahbut it was only really we had that we had those soul D J s that that that were blowing them that was the problem
Yeah
And they shouldn't have blown
Now there's some mild mannered rock D J to
to look after the speakers
True
I hear you were at the Empire the other night
I was indeed yes
Just sniffing about you know see what's going on
How many were in
Four hundred or so
That bad is it
Wednesday night
Cos I thought I was quite impressed
And I thought
Yeah
flipping hell
They're doing sum mat right
He's bashing down from the campus
How much is it to get in
A quid
Cheap drinks
Yeah well I mean a quid a pint or something isn't it
Yeah
A pound a pint for lager and one twenty for P il s
That's
I mean so there's he's still making a reasonable mark - up on that
Mm
I mean well not a reasonable mar he's still making money on the drinks
Mm
it's not as if you're like selling them at cost and making a few pence because
Mm mm
No
I must say I was quite su r pri I've never set foot in the place before since that time we went down before it was open
Yeah
Really
M hm
Mm
Yeah I've got my band playing down there in a couple of weeks
You know Line Birds
Cos they'll be down there
Oh
Your la your lads
Yeah
At the er and they have a band on that night that I just called on for the
Is that the one that they had some problems with the er rug by club
Yeah
And they were standing in the front as I'm going
Like this
And they we I don't think they were very amused
The band or the rug by club
Yeah er well both
by all account
Well I dunno I don't know what it is
Very unusual
They start wanker bit you know it's like all they tend
to do
Mm
They're only small lads you know sort of playing guitars and stuff
I don't think they were gonna play anything
Because there's only a couple they only had a couple of security guards didn't they
Ooh
I know
Outside
Well
Yeah
Nigel was saying that they only had a couple you know cos they like you
Well it's hard to tell the manager's a bounce r isn't he
Er he looked
Oh yeah
Paul
He used to be
Mm
he used to he used to do bounce r there yeah
Yeah I swore I'd seen him before
Yeah
I couldn't work out where I'd seen him
He was here from the very first cos he worked for Hills you know that sort of
Mm
gangster crew from Black pool
M hm
Er m he worked he was their sort of er m they had a few clubs and pub s in this are a at the time and er
Mm
he was that sort of head of the
Yeah I know what yo yeah I'm sure I'd seen him before
And trouble shot around various establishment s
Then he went so solo he he got er m er doing regular thing up at er m Ocean Heads I think or sum mat
Oh
But definitely so he sort of went on his own and then went back into building and decorating and then when the Empire opened he started there from the off
But now he sort of seems to be with other contracts
Mm
Cos the last I see he's been made redundant now hasn't he
Oh
You don't know it you won't know it then
No
Then Mar this guy called Mark is there I think
But Paul's head over that now so I mean he's doing well for himself
Mm
Yeah well I was er m I was trying to get get a night down there deejay ing as well
I wa I was told you had got one
Mm
I was told you'd got one or two

Yes
Yeah
Sing a couple of songs and er
Yeah

I don't know cos I've never actually er m been in a place where they've done sort of thing really
Yeah
Two Unlimited 's the first one I think
Well they've er done a couple of couple of
I mean if that does er er I mean Two Unlimited ought to do alright
If
Mm
if it if it's gonna do alright then that'll be
Mm
reasonable
But it's getting a bit carried away I mean he was talking to Nigel about er doing er the Level le r s in er
Mm
in the tent you know
Doubt if you put oh we can put four and half thousand people into that
Well
Well yeah
Yeah he was also he said most of them he said er
Seven hundred in the Sugar House maybe
well they're playing Guild Hall aren't they
Yeahbut yeah
Difference between playing Guild Hall and filling Guild Hall
Mm
True
I dunno they'rethey're damn popular if only I mean
Yeah
I know
It was one of the best
but I would I wouldn't have sa
selling album s of last year

Yeah
I wouldn't I I mean yeahbut I mean I wouldn't have thought I mean they're certainly
No it wouldn't do four thousand
No
I mean
I mean I wouldn't
you
No
know
I would have thought that for More cam be they're probably looking at like a thousand eleven hundred people if you know
Yeah
would be a good one
I would have thought
Yeah
Well I'm sort of like
Depends on timing
Foot in the door a bit see see if I can sort of you know
You alright

I'm just starting to
You know what he's doing really so
Yeah
sort of well a couple of nights deejay ing will do me for a start really
Who's doing a Wednesday night then
Wellhe's doing it last wee I wouldn't mind doing the Wednesday actually cos I can do that sort of you know student discos you know so
Yep
and I don't have to go to work on Thursday so you know th that always helps
Right
So likewise the Saturday nights here I'm alright I don't have to get up in the morning
Mm
Ha
Yeah
What is it on Wednesday is it ten till ten till two or nine till two or
Er m
what do they do a bus shuttle
Er I think they have I think they'd have I think they have two buses on er er a week so and then they go back if there's any more
It's a long haul that inn it though
Mm
Here
I mean how many students are from More cam be nowadays
Er d'ya know
I've no idea
Must be a fair number
I've no idea to be honest
There's not as many as there used to be
No
Nonono
I mean we when I when I came here it was virtually virtually half half the population of that
And then there was maybe a thousand people out of out of More cam be
Mm
That's it
And the Uni was then only about two thousand eight hundred strong
Mm
But there's quite a lot of er m development in Lancaster now
They're doing loads of er m flats and there's all those all that stuff round High cross are a
Yeah
But
Is it
I think so but well that's part of St. Martin's College really isn't it that er
Some of it is
I thought some of it was the Uni
But you know I mean if the Uni goes to ten thousand in what what is it it's getting up for about ninety five ninety six
It's quite quick
Something like that
It's
Yeah
very quick really
Yeah I mean that well it's only fo well it's four five thousand now
But I mean you're talking
Six

It's always packed out with students these days
Must have got some student then

It's er
Mind you it's convenient for the Sugar House inn it
Yeah

And cos Carole went in

I've given out three hundred invites and sit around with
Well that's reminded me the er m
twenty people
the er m L an cy 's is one of the places they were thinking of upstairs
Aha

Right
for er m everyone in the family and wanting a a night do you know for
Mm
for all their mates and such like
When's the when is the wedding or when's the reception

Ere rm Saturday the
No a time what time are they planning

Is there a gap I mean how big is the gap between like the reception and the party kind of thing
Er I haven't got a clue

Why's that then
Well he was talk we were talking about the rave and th what was wrong with it and he was saying basically it was they'd got four DJ s who were all techno and they were like brilliant
He said you know that you won't get better
techno D 's outside London and then even then they could pushing it I mean they're all their own mixes do all their own mixes and
Mm
you know they're and the scratching guy he said is best he's ever heard anywhere
He said but it's the same all night long you know
And I said well I know nothing about that kind of music but that's the impression I got I was just stood there at the bar thinking that last last Friday it's not the same one thinking you know this is just this is just very same y it
Mm
sounds really same y
So er m oh cheers mate
So he said yeah he said it's like you know it's like if played er m
That
you know thrash all night long on a Saturday night you're gonna have fiftysixty people who think it's wonderful but you're never gonna get more than fiftysixty people
Er m so he ju he was taking it over for a couple of weeks
Anyway
Alright
Hello there
You know
cutting a long story short
Saying how good you were
He said to say cos he we were talking about DJ s in general and how basically if performing artist if anything else you know you've still gotta react to your audience and all that sort of thing
Yeah
and he's er yes er
What the hell does he know anyway
He was saying you taught he he taught him everything he knows
Ho
This didn't say Alistair e that I know and love
He was saying how he used to stand a we struck in the Sugar House and listen to you all night long
And learnt all the tricks of the trade
I thought he always there
I thought Mark in the Sugar House he was drunk
most of the time
You know
Yeah that's why he was so good
No I said to Dean he was
Will I give him a job there
And anyway you ought to try you ought to have tried telling him a few
Mm
Yeah well he does get a bit of over the top
No No
I mean this was like this was like
I mean he's not even
mid day on a Saturday
Yeah
Yeah
No adrenalin buzzing no
Well he doesn't drink any more but
No
He's given up smoking as well hasn't he
Aye
He was actually reasonably reasonably pleasant
Except when he went off into fi fantasy land
Battling up and down motor ways in cars
Sorting out drug dealers the length and breadth of the British Isles
Oh yeah
Regular Robin Hood
Stop and search him
Yeah
Rob Roy
Yeah well at least it's only
Rob Roy
he owes me anyway
That he's owed me for a year
Just about
What was that from
Nothing
Yeah
Well he's got himself a B M W and he can't pay pay his record bill
Ooh
Sounds like Trevor to me
Is Trevor still buying
What happened with Brooks
Dunno
But I sa but I knew Mick was doing
or something
I know that
It's what
He's so open
Oh yeah
Ye yeah
Er er I know I know
I just wonder what's I last I heard they were the receiver was trying to pull it into the collapse but er
Oh
Don't know
I thought they did quite well
I thought it was go make a club
Well it's the only club in in Lancaster that's that's the problem
Yeah he always seems to fiddle
Well I mean the Sugar House is
Mm
is
Mm
a student place and always will
Yeah
be and
It is crap
What Brook
Brook
Cos those
Oh I know
er m
as town night clubs go
Yeah but it's a club
I mean it's
and there's no alternative is there
Hi Ken
I dunno what's
And there's what have I got
U r g h b r u r g h
b r u r g h hundred and mm mm mm mm mm eighty hundred and eighty pound must be two hundred in
Ha
Yeah
Pretty good
Yeah
Must be twenty come in without and paying and I've let a few in for
Mm
Mm
bit less than two fifty
Oh
Jolly good
So it's not bad
Mm
Don't know how the bar's coping though
Oh
They're alright
Are they
I think it b i but they're doing alright
They'll manage
That's what they're there for inn it
Yeah
Got no er no change at the moment that's the only problem
Yeah always seem to be going for some er
I just send er
What's it
Alan
Alan
Alan
Got some at home apparently tucked away in a piggy bank or something
He's robbed it off somebody
How many
Ain't he
were on the bus then
It was absolutely jam - p a c k e d full by the sta the standing I didn't count them
No well
Will it be ab be about ninety i sh I would think
Mm
Ninetyninety two sum mat like that
Yeah we had like fifty in before fifty or sixty
Before the bus come
Mm mm
Came
Yeah it's picking up again nicely
Mm
Well it's a bad time of year ain't it since Christmas
I mean January
Yes yeah that's a point
anyway I mean and then all the sort of ups and downs with the press publicity et cet era
Mm
Course yeah
Yeah
One or two have mentioned on Thursday actually so I think best we're open well before
See how that goes when they feel it
Well I was just talking to Jean about that today I mean I we've gotta keep on doing it but I think that
Yeahif you stop now you'll get nowhere with them will you
No that's right
But I mean I think we I think I I will need on Monday morning to talk to er More cam be Bay and see if I can bring forward these promotions because
Yeah
until I start
Yeah
I mean we should get them back
You can't al also I think you should start doing having people regular again wi it's just
I know
not worth it
The trouble is it's a bit of a catch twenty two because if you don't put a bus on will you get the people
Mm
It's what you do inn it
That's the problem with it
the bus for er
I mean nobody actually
and nobody on it
nobody's actually said to me a well where where's the bus on a Thursday
Nobody's said it yet
When they
Mm mm
start asking
Mm
then that transport you could ask about putting it back on again
I mean what a what I think I'll probably do is if we can get like er m something that's obviously our crowd and then either putting sayS tell a back on or something like that
Mm
and banging it out for one
Can you not stick a band on pretty soon or nothing like that
Well
People would think we were
frankly I'm not sure where that stands
I mean talking to Charlie just asking about getting some student bands on
Yeah
might be an idea cos remember when we had that thin Mar
when we had that thin Martin's band on
Yeahbut I was in
I mean
gonna say stick them back on cos they
Yeah
went down really well
And they brought a big following down didn't they
They brought a big following
Yeahthat's right
Er I mean if you if they if they
There was about a hundred with thin Martin on the other hand
Yes
Yes
It was a really good night that
If you make it known that there's stuff like that going on if you get a band like that you can always just
Mm
put a bus on for some people that come down
Mm
You get a couple of leads like that it'll start picking up
Yeah
up there
That's right
So
Like ya like you say it is a difficult situation at the moment inn it
Mm
And what to do for the best
Mm
Yeah
But I I say if I get sh publicity I er if I say do if I say cos we haven't got a premium lager on draft so if I stick Stella on dr aught
Mm
and then do it as an offer
You
Eleven best we can do in
Okay
and fives
Great
So you gotta take it up
Yeah
Great
there
Get it up to Terri
I'll get you a bottle full then this
Yeah

When do you start when do you start fishing again then
D'ya think
In a couple of weeks I think
It's alright if you're
Mm
I'm playing again up till no all normal now
Like that was saying if you wanted to about three months cos I mean kept putting
Mm
him off putting him off
But I'm getting a I'dI'd I'm up to normal now I've got everything back on a normal par I think
So
Mm
Mm
I start before you start I'm going fishing now
What you go out in the i is it in the summer when you go out the boat
Or the er m spring or sum mat
Well summer I don't know I'd like to go for about it whe whether it's calm or not you know if it's nice and calm but
M hm
well that's a a place like More cam be I just couldn't be bothered
Yeah
So I go at any time late at night
I say over Christmas though my car was in its garage in bits
So that didn't go down too well with our lot but it's either that or it blow up all the time
Yeah
Do you go out far
Or do you just you fe in a
in a boat or do you go out far
Depends last time we went out we went just off Long bay Island other side of Walla se y
Yeah I know
Yeah
So one guy caught a twenty eight pound er like
You know good fishing out there
But otherwise you stop in har b our fish
Mm
You can take your chance
How long how long can you stay out
I mean I you know how long does th
Usually if
how long's the tide and that
if you go out on a charter it's twelve hours you know if you go for
Yeahbut then you're going out a distance aren't you
To other side of Walla se y you do twelve
Yeah
hours
No I mean if you just keep using the bay
Oh aye
the bay
Depends on time you go out for a time
Mm
come in with tide
eight hours
Can you
Yeah
But now this dinghy club that my mate's and he he's got tractors at C rome r that take them out of water so
Mm
Mm
he's a fisher full time
Yeah
Mm
What's it like around the power station
Is is there is there are they p lo ugh ing warm water into into there or is it
Well there's warm water coming out int there
Yeah
Well I presume I presumed there was
Yeah
Mm
That's right
I mean is it affecting any of that good fishing up there or is that
Well the
that a
I can certainly you can float for and the mo or
Mm
Yeah
You can float from but you get a lot of soft wind
Right
But plenty of them around
I never use them as well as my own
That's
Mm
right
Is there much mackerel around
In boat
Er like when you go out and catch mackerel you use it for fresh bait then
Yeah
So
See it's not a bad fish to eat actually mackerel
Mind you we don't eat fish
No
And I went to last summer we took a er I took a sha er not a sha er m tt static car a van in at er Pres ta ty n an and er m
M hm
and like we were just flick ing through Ce e fax on the telly and it was like one of these luxury six bert h ones and it was ninety nine quid for a week and and
Really
I mean it was beautiful inside
They're normally like a two hundred and fiftythree hundred quid one
Mm
but it was it was cos you had you know you had to go that week kind of thing
So we just thought well then
Er m I took the nine year old boat out and just went out in a boat we had Mary went as well we were like the all job for mackerel put this guy's
M hm
twelve guys on that's what I didn't want two small mackerel caught in over
Mm
three hours you know
Poor guy was going well I don't understand it you know normally we Went to er m Malt a last year and there was a great er m tt it's called an underwater safari but you know normally when you're like on Winder mere like you've got a glass - b o t t o m e d boats
Oh have they
well this was the all the ho all the hull underneath the water line was glass so you were actually sitting you know you weren't looking down you were actually sitting in in the base of the hull of the boat
Yeah
and and going and they went er it went out in off to er some of these islands off er rocks and that tour of Malt a and that it was superb
You were abs you know you were er absolute I mean it was it was
Yeah
as good as aqua lung ing without actually getting wet it was great you know
Very good idea that
Must have made a fortune
It was packed like three or four times a day
Yeah
Yeah
I mean people are fascinated by the sea aren't they
They really are
Oh yeah
My wife's just gone America shark fishing
Oh yeah
Right
Yeah
Off Mexico down that way
Yeah
Marlin big marlin
Yeah
That's what they call big marlin
Sixteen quid a day it is to put boat
Yeah
out there
It's not much really is it
My friend went last year
They pay that in bloody mackerel fishing
Oh aye
for the twelve hours don't you
Oh yeah
Yeah
He went out he went fly - d r i v e last year and he went down
Have you seen that
to Mexico
have you seen that movie it was on er m tt I was watching a programme the other day about it
They've developed a camera for your line for th for the mackerel for the ma marlin and the shark fishing er m and basically you can actually watch you can you can ac you've got a your T V screen so it it's er it's like a spectator sport as well cos you can actually watch the the the fish coming to take your bait
Yeah
You know so it's like yo you've got on this minute camera on the line and everything you know so it so that you can actually get the excitement of watching it you know coming and taking
Can we have a little bit of a discount
Yeah you can
Course you can
How much is it then
Couple of quid each
Couple of quid each
Couple of quid each
So we can start
Shark fishing's only
That's all you have that's only have to have a little bit
Yeah
Yeah
You've asked for a lot
Can we have a lot of a discount please
Only gotta drink drink drink that's lots of drink a drink
A drink a drink
Give us three quid for the pair of you
Right
You give him three quid and I'll give the rest in
Cheers
Yeah
So you buy first two beers then
Yeah
Fair enough
No
Well isn't it
Well I did
The guy was talking to Pete he thought he could he develop he could develop for co arse fishing
Bye bye
er you know river fishing and that as well there's spa special camera
Well where does the actual camera hang off
It's hung it it's hung i i it's actually not below the boat but but it
Oh
Sure can
get it you see but i it's fantastic watching cos you know they were they they it was sort of going along the
Yeah
whatever they were using as bait presumably some mackerel or something like that but but as I was saying you could see it trailing through and then all suddenly out of like nowhere this fish would come and like chase after it
Yeah
and snap and this this would go off and you'd be sat there going right then you actually
Well presumably
see it take it you know
the camera eye would be adjust able would it
Or
I presume so yes
I mean they was talking about getting a really small for er m
Oh right
you know to be to be used in in sort of co arse fishing and that
Mm
But of course the other thing of course i it takes out the the one that got away cos you actually see the one that got away
Yeah
you know
Yeah
There'd be some story then
You know what'll happen is your camera would
the cameras 'll magnify it anyway won't it
Yeah it will
It will do
Yeah
Yeah
But it was really I mean it it meant of course that the other people on the boat could have some enjoyment as well cos I mean there's nothing worse i if you if there's only one rod out or two rods out th those boats there's only like a couple of rods out int there on on
Mm
those for the marlin and the and the sharks and that fishing
And you don't get many
Yeah
And it's not like sort of
Three there'll be
twelve
three or four maximum
twelve rods out yeah
something like that
Yeah
So any anybody else that's going on board is bored out their brains basically
But at least
Yeah
if you got T V monitors you can watch what's going
Watch it
on
That's really good
So nownow I mean now with all the radar and whatever else we're using I mean you should really be able to find fish
Well that that boat from Eve sh am that we went out on a couple a years ago it had a fish finder on it
Mm
So it er fish finder on it
Yeah
You throw your line out you don't get a few just biting
No
No that's right
That's right
They've done most of them are I mean the wo certainly the ones on the little little boat trips and that I mean they have all it does is that it'll tell you there's some fish about I mean it doesn't
Mm
tell you where to fish or
Oh no
depths or anything like that does it
What they're doing is there's some fish down there somewhere
Mm
Cos that's the most frustrating thing about fishing is when you're like you know you could be wasting that you you think to yourself like I could be wasting a whole there's not a fish anywhere round here
You know you could be sat here like an idiot today
Well that's it I've I've sat on
for hours on end
Jay hours on end in middle of night freezing
Mm
you know like and I've caught nothing
And you've
Yeah
thought well there's plenty of crabs in
Yeah
summer take your bait
Yeah
but every time you throw out there's a crab on end of it
You know
Yeah
Yeah
you think why does that crab always have to come my line
And all this sea yet it has to get my worm
And same like no fish you think well there must be fish out there
Yeah
Well it's it's luck inn it
I don't know
I don't know what's going on
I don't we got about three three thirty in the morning both of them went out to er canal somewhere up Du l gate past Du l gate we set up and we'd we'd been fishing for about two and half hours it's a ba about six thirty in the morning this old farmer comes up says er ayeaye lads he said er I wouldn't bother it they drained this are a of the canal a few months ago
And we said oh
Yeah
Sat there watching our floats for hours
I mean
Yeah
I mean luckily you you know you'd gone on a car with a car so it's a matter of throwing everything in the back and just going
That's it
somewhere else so could have sat there all bleeding day
And not have known anything about it
Aye
I've had some lonely nights
Yeah
Do you catch many e else el s or anything many eel s
No
Didn't catch as many this year as what I have done
P h w or g h
The slimy things that they are
Yeah
You get one of the lads that works with me if he catches three of them he says well I'll have them for my dinner
Yeah
I know
I know
They look horrible
A deli ca cy
Mind you I ate conga
I I er mI was off the west co er on a holiday to the west coast of Ireland and we er m we're driving down the west coast and there was like some rocks and everything about so we stopped and you know I looked by a rock pools or something and there's this and the rock pool is like mini - s w i m m i n g baths they were you know probably
Mm
twelve foot long and about six or seven foot wide and about
Mm mm
six or seven foot deep and they're crystal clear
And there was this old guy dragging this bloody rope with a massive hook on the end like after after you know I presume it was cod or mackerel something along the and I said what the hell are you fishing
You know cos the woman I was with wanted to go for a swim and I said no you can't this guy so I went up to him I said what what on earth are you fishing for
He said oh there's three cong as live in this pool
It was like a four foot one a five foot one there's a six foot one over in the centre there's a rock in the centre of it
Oh right
that came out the water said look over there
I said bloody hell
You know and I said to her you were gonna go swimming in there
He said ooh he said there was some American students here last week and they were all swimming in there and the man came along with this thing and they bo they were all sat on the middle lo middle of there with their feet dangling in the water splashing away he said I was dragging this down and this six foot er came out I said and then they were he said you've never seen anybody run so fast in your life like they go
they were dangling their toes at the end of this thing
Yeah
Yeah
Oh aye
And then the next day I went along and he actually caught the five foot one and ki and killed it and he gave us a load of steaks off it that I sort of
Baked
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
The trouble was they were really bony that's the only thing it was and I don't like eating
Well
fish and bo with bones in I can't stand it
well you can't fillet them can you
No
No
Impossible
Impossible
No
Cos it's like a central spinal
Yeah
and it's all off it so you'd be just you know it's not like
Normal flat
a fish a flat fish
I mean but it was really nice it was it was a really chewy meat you know
But
Yeah
like shark or something and er
There's supposed to be decent cong as off Beach y
Is there
You know the old
Mm
oil
Yeah
It's me
Down there

But you know about the stories you hear
Yeah
I've never actually seen one
No
They're ugly looking fish aren't they
Bloody horrible fish
But er evil looking things
This guy was great though we met in Ireland cos he was er m he used to own about three or four supermarkets er small chains and he just one day he's about he's about fifty eight sixty now and one day he said about five years ago he just got fed up and just walked out
All he does is fish all day long
And he
Yeah
just he lives in somebody's basement of a house and like in return for living there he fills the guy's freezer up with lobster crab you know
Mm mm
fish and that and er m everything he does in the village i in Kil rush is everything he just you know he wants a new pair of shoes wants a coat brings
Yes
a couple of lobster you know and things like tha cos like to him he he's got his crab lines and his lobster pots all the time and all that
Er m to it's really back to the old barter system
Yeah
Yeah
It's superb
Really good
Eh
Excuse me
Ohoh ohoh
Have you not seen Ken
No
Oh go and get Ken then
Again
Yeah
You mean same as last week
Yeah yes
Yes yes I was helping him

See and I've helped Kenny out and a few the lads before and like we always finish it that's why I come this cellar Barry
Oh right
Oh
Do you want one
Yeah
Just one just one
go on go on
Just tell send Alan down again
Alan
Said it's alright
Have you ever tried octopus
Er m no
Er no I haven't
No
I mean squid I've eaten a lot of
Bit like that inn it
Squid
Yeah
I've had octopus soup
That was quite well a weird taste
I like shark
Have you eaten shark
No
Oh I like shark it's really nice cos it it's really meat y I mean it's like eating meat
Like steak though inn it
Yeah
Yeah it's like steak
That's right
It's nice and ju tender I believe
Yeah
Yeah
But
But it's sort of thick and chewy it's not you know it's not flaky like fish it's like a almost like a meat
It's really good
They do in er m where do they do it round here always
Er m always got it in er m tt oh
Mick at Joseph 's place Mick and Jose er m in Lancaster
Oh God
Above the Bang and O lu f sen shop in Lancaster d'ya know Robertson's of Leicester
Up King Street
Yeah
Next to Plato 's
Yeah
The er m electrical shop
Yeah
It's above there
Oh
So it's a it's a nice place cos it's like it they do a great spread of I mean you can go for like a nice meal there but you can like also eat you know dips and
Yeah
hamburger
Yeah
or whatever a big steak or whatever you want and the
And how do you cook it
They cook it i they cook it in er Ca jun in it's a sort of in a sort of spice thing they have sort of Mexican not Mexican er m tt Ca jun South American and
Yeah
some states of America around the Mississippi New Orleans
Aha
New Orleans
Er but I've had it just grilled you know and always done in butter
In butter
Yeah
Yeah
But I like trying all these things now and again
M hm
Mm
You ca I mean you occasionally see it in the fish markets
Yeah
And er I mean things like squid and that I ca I quite like but I'd never think of get buying it I wouldn't buy it and cook it myself or anything
I just
Oh no
the trouble is once you actually
Tried that
so what sorry
I remember once you know getting and cutting a rabbit and things by the time you'd actually cut the th i damn thing
You've gone off it
you'd gone off it cos you'd been heading and gut ting it and whatever else
And you know you're sat there and you think
Yeah
I don't really wanna eat this you know
It's alright if it comes to you in a ca in a in a as a as a meal
Comes up ready - m a d e
Yeah
But er when you actually see what you're doing to it you know
I had this octopus once in Germany and it we'd gone out for a meal and I was gonna have steak and mushrooms and
Mm
er the lads said what are we having the starters like
I said oh I'll have what you're ordering
Well they ordered soup of the day you see and they brought this I tasted it had a real funny a weird taste
Mm
anyway and I sort of said to the waitress why what was it
She said octopus
U r g h
You wouldn't have had it if you'd have known
No
I don't think I would
No
It's not something
No
I would have picked
No
I wouldn't
I certainly
Well
wouldn't
it was it were
I mean I like fish but I wouldn't I wouldn't choose it
Had a funny taste but it was quite nice
Yeah
What was it a sort of fishy ta I mean was it a sort of fishy soup
No
No
It didn't have a fishy taste it we like beef but I presume it's the way they've cooked it
Mm
Cos they all put spice s in and everything
But er I definitely wouldn't have ordered it
No
No
Like now I don't think I would order it again
Yeah
But then I had steak and mushrooms to follow
Quite nice
So if you don't eat what you catch why choose
Why do I wanna
sea fishing
No I mean I cos I you know I i I spend a long time co arse fishing so I understand actual fishing for pleasure as opposed to
Yeah yeah
like to eat you know there's not much you can catch co arse fishing that you can eat anyway er m but most people who go sea fishing do it to eat what they catch
Or to sell what they catch or whatever I mean
Aha
Mm
I I do it I like I like
But why sea fi why why does sea fishing interest you and not co arse fishing sort of thing
Because you there's more opportunity for big ones
Mm
if anything
Mm
Like you go canal fishing you know you're only getting
Yeahthat's right
like you get the odd four and half pound
Yeah
pike or chub
Yeah
whatever
Yeah
but you know you you come to the fairly big 'un s out there
So
Mm
so I suppose that's why I do it
Mm
Yeah
To see if I can get a big one
Mm
Can you get
You going home
away now
No
Nothing like trying to get rid of me is there
Are you going home
I'm no bother

so many
Ern on owe were I mean last night we'd gone up from the week before on a rave we'd had about si ninety in and last night we had about two hundred and fifty
So
Is the is the Fridays
normally better than Saturdays er money - w i s e t h e taking s
I mean is it more
Well it's i
people in
er er er er er it it hasn't been I mean i it it was last night was the first one that had gone on to like over two hundred
So this week you've done well Friday and Saturday
Yeah
cos you've got more in
That's right
It's not bad though is it
No
No
But I mean it's now it's coming to the end of January people are starting to get paid again and starting to have paid off their Christmas
I mean that's been the killer
You know you've had Christmas then you get hit with all your credit cards and all then you get hit with all the electricity and gas and telephone
Electricity gas and telephone and everything
Can you explain why it's dear er on Fridays and Saturdays
Cos it's different type of event and music
You don't think if you
if you put it up to same they wouldn't come likely
No
No
So it's
No
No
you don't complain at this you don't complain at two fifty er each one no
No
Well some of them do
Well some of them do but not not serious not serious
No I meant you don't you're not bothered you don't mind
It's
No I mean
you make twice as much on a Friday on the door as you do on the Saturday
No we don't
No we don't cos we don't we don't promote it you see on a Friday
Oh
So they
They
don't promote cos they
they pay for the hire of the hall
They pay for the hire yeah
But you've gotta say oh right
So whatever they make on the door
Yeah
after they've paid
Yeah
for the hire is profit
But they s pen they spend a lot of money on on lights and they I mean they they spend they spend about seven hours in here on a Friday just doing the lights and special effects and
I like that smoke one
I saw it first time last week and it were great
Yeah
Really
Well the the first time they were here when they gonna have the all ni when they were gonna have the all - n i g h t e r er m they hired a laser in it was superb

Well I've been here every week and there's no bother with them or
No
No no
Anyway
Oh well
you can't beat the system can you
You can't

left at the end of the night
I mean not all our customers abs are absolutely stupid
Buy a bottle at five to two and leave it at two o'clock
It's the nice ones that leave their drink there
Mm
I'm amazed they haven't
Well anyway I was talking to er Rose t te tonight cos I went to the office for some change and I then I had this like
She said I hear the Empire or or hear The Garden 's doing well on a Friday night
Must have heard about that from Alan
He goes it's too fucking dead
Well it's it last day of week
Where
Popping up to Chris ties and just after you go up the top
Nonono where
Where are you talking about
The Empire
But apparently they're doing quite well on a Wednesday with the students
Students yeah I know
And er m Mark was in last week he said
They're getting six hundred like
well Mark said it was Mark er guessed about four hundred
He's he he went in last week he went in this week and er
Well Paul Paul said to me six hundred about seven hundred
Yeah
normally he said he said well there would be about six hundred
Ni Nigel mentioned he told me it was er m er like four five hundred in tt to
Not bad though is it
Well it's very good inn it
I mean on a Wednesday
And it's only a quid to get in and it's a pound pound a pint
Two quid and and a drink yeah
But on the other hand they're making a little bit at a pound a pint
Well they're making five or six hundred they're bound
to be getting on with it
That's right
That's getting in the
I don't think they've got a lot of staff on
I wouldn't have thought they'd bother with a
No
student night having a lot of staff on it's pointless having ah I mean the bounce r s in that situation
Well you'd only need one
But we don't need a bounce r on
Except mind you the the rough the er m rug by club gave the band a bit of era rough seeing to
What band
He had some band that were awful apparently and the
whole of the rug by team were lying in front of stage with their
They they've never left they were playing the rug by club
fingers up
Nonono no no
No
University
University rug by club
Oh
The Un i's

The band went ran off in tears apparently
Couldn't cope
Seeing the University Rug by Club I would I would have eh
Mm
Must be some n ark y bastards in the rug by club
Oh
I can't get it out it's stuck on his collar I hope she comes back for it next week
But six hundred on a Wednesday night that's pretty good
Mm
Does the Sugar House get that many people in
No
No
The Sugar House only opens er Thursday Friday Saturday
Or or o we always have done
I mean we we opened originally first year every night of the bloody week and it was pointless absolutely pointless
Is that bigger than the Empire
I've never been in it
Yeah
No
Er yeah
Yes it is
Is it
It's legal it's legal
Well it's on it's on a Thursday yeah
it's it's legally bigger than the Empire but the Empire can get more people in cos he's got upstairs and
Yeah
that
Mm
see
But of course er m for licensing they don't take that particularly into consideration up there
Well they half upstairs straight away
Yeah
Yeah
So er
I mean I think I I think the Empire legally is well I thought it was nine hundred
Seven fifty I think
I can't think er I don't know
I think it's nine hundred
I mean you could cer you could
Well I thought it was seven fifty
certainly get seventeen eighteen hundred in there
Well yeah
Even that Bob Monk house opened up quite
Yeah
quite nice
Yeah
Well they'll have the Garden won't they
Oh yeah
Mind you
Probably fucking tell by cos there was I thought
They we
there was too many
Yeah
But I mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first
Mm
few months weren't they
No twelve twelve or thirteen
They never had fifteen
Didn't they
I mean the Sugar House his capacity 's
just been upped to eleven hundred I think
Er m I mean it was always nine hundred but it's been upped to eleven hundred last year I think
Well we used to put I mean I put twelve thirteen hundred in the Sugar House
But tha but you it's full at that you know
Mm
Whereas the the the you you could you could you could fit sixteen seventeen hundred
No I reckon th th there was th th they reckon between a a thousand and e eleven hundred for a night you know
But you couldn't fucking move at that
Yeahbut it was a it was also a ver it was a bit of a celebrity I mean it was peoplepeople were crushed around bloody hell I mean
Yeahthat's right
yeah
all the downstairs I mean all the ple b s were upstairs all the downstairs was er m
Yeah but ma maybe maybe a hundred people
Mm
I'm sure
I mean I don't know I you see I left I had to come here so I left before Bob Monk house and everything I just I all I did was go for couple of free drinks and plate of free food which I don't think I got
And left
You get a few fucking with the chef

You'd left me
I had to leave
You'd fled us
And gone to work for the opposition
Were you op well I didn't reckon you were opposition
But I did go out or something
Just cos you thought you were go

Mm
I mean they're all charts e y stuff but
Mm
you know I I da that kind of stuff doesn't draw punters generally chart stuff cos the people who go
I dunno I think the young
the people who are interested
I think the young people go to it like
Well me yeah maybe
Maybe some of that will
Yeah
But generally pop poppy type
A lot a lot of
Top of the Pops stuff doesn't in the sense that people who like to go and see live music don't people who like that kind of music prefer the dis prefer it in a
Yeah
disco context
Yeah
Yeah
Not not seeing sort of a live concert
Anyway
In fact in fact most of the stuff they don't like anyway
Mm
True

A bit too tired don't you think
Most teams do in F A.
It was er first division
Who
Well second division teams
No they don't
They've planted a new tree there haven't they
Where
There
Where
The one right in front at the very
Well that's been there ever since we moved in
No not that bush
I mean that
No the tree
Yeah
Has it
Yeah
Well I can't remember that now
Unless it was small and it's grown
So when you don't know when you go back in then
The time the trains are
Nope
Could do that
They're getting some more tomorrow aren't they
I don't know yet
Cos in you don't know if it'll be moved by then
Cos she said they're moving it aren't they
From his bedroom
Yes
That'll take about ten minutes
Oh it would
If more comes in
Do you want me to get that
No I'll get it
What what he's what he's had to say isisis to is to get the ball rolling and get some money and then we can start looking
He'll give us that
Mm
without any security
Mm
Can have that for starters
At a write off of thirty pound a barrel
Oh
He's going to write off one as well
This is what he's saying yeah
S so you don't get involved or anything this is we can just sign it off
All he wants off us we're gonna give him anal yse s of your last three months' invoices
Right
Right
And then wants just some form of a business plan which
Mm
is probably similar to what your
Yeah
Yeah
What you did that on that other thing
And then and he'll come and see us sort it all out sort the installation out and er m and and
we've got fifteen left
Then we then he says then wha well cos what we're saying is then if your barrel age goes up to four barrels say
Mm
go back and get another ten to fifteen
Another write off
Mm
er another write off
He says so you you you you you're not you're not sting ing yourself up to something er
Mm
and you take as you improve the business
It's whether you know what we've got to look at really is what what basis we can use that fifteen thou for
Mm
That's right
As a starter
That's right
You know
The biggest thing is a case of refurbish ment to is that that's what we want
That cocktail bar looks alright in the corner over there
Mm
Then you could sort of do something with the
Yeah
Yeah
Bas let's wander round and have a look
I mean
Mm
Er do you want there's another the idea of what that
What do you think on that Barry on that score
Yeah
If we can get fifteen quickly
Yeah
Cos we've missed the March he said because th it's the new financial year so
Aha
Aha
you know so if we can ge if we can get fifteen in quickly we can start saying well look while
Mm
we're gonna spend that fifteen
Yeah
for
That's right
And then get it going
Anyway I said we'll have to
Yeah
I mean basically blokes have written everything off
Yeah
So so I mean they've just walked
Yeah
away from the whole thing so
So
with all the pumps heads
All yo all
cellar everything
all we're gonna have to do is put that in well we might
Yeah
we might we might what money we're saving we might be able to say well what about something
Yeah
you know
Yeah
Yeah
We will turn round but I say
We we own this you know d'ya wanna buy it can d'ya wanna buy the equipment
Mm
They might say well put new in you know but gonna save them an arm and a leg and maybe we can ah either negotiate something definite or
Well it's not it's I mean it's not only the cost of the equipment it's actually the cost of p u installing it
You know you need
That's right yeah
to have a company in to install it
won't need to push
Gonna be it's gonna be I mean it's a long run it's it's
Yeah
gonna be a good two days
Yeah
wanted to do that
Well they they'll put a condition on as well
Have a word with Colin
Yeah
Right
Here we are
Here we are backstage
Er m that's just cupboard staff toilets and spirit stuff in there
Yeah
are a
Sa what's that for
Ice making machine
Oh yeah
That's what we want a
Dishwasher
glass was her
Er m there's one freezer that's a freezer
Er it's small but well it's a reasonable kitchen
Yeah it's quite a good one
int it
really
Fridge
They do say that er that the er it's
cos you have to anything on there food - w i s e
Yeah you've got to have food anyway
So I mean if they've had it
But
Mm
I mean it's it's er it needs somebody working at it full time
Yeah
er m and just being being prepared to su suffer a few months of building
Yeah
it up basically
Yeah
That's that's the that's where you've got er freezer freezer and a chest freezer there as well
That's a lift straight down to the cellar
Who put that in
Charlie
Tha I mean the whole building's brand new he well
Yeah
I mean it's what
Er eight years
Yeah
old or whatever
Er we've got all packed in for I mean that might be worth putting back on
No
Doubt
When it
if it's
when it got to the stage that we only open like one and a half days a week
Yeah
we said well it's not really worth from your company's point of view such an expensive piece of equipment for a I mean was doing the process thing then you know we could utilize the equipment elsewhere
But er if you're not really gonna be still like split cups but well
Yeah
it's it's useful for the gas sort of thing
Oh yeah
Whatever whatever
I mean we'll
Yeah
be expecting that
Yeah
Well yo do your
So
do do you know
Oh yeah
Yeah I know that
Well when everything's sorted that's it
So you got there's a lot of wasted space in this club
Mm
Phenomenal amount of wasted space
Yeah
I used to think what
Where does this lead to
This is the back of the the disco
Yeah
Right there was a disco
console on the back
Mm
Right
Aye
And I got I've got about two hundred of these poly - f o a m chairs as well back
Yeah
there which I got off one of my
Here's the piano
That's the piano
And these are
Yeah
I mean we have on a couple of occasions always done like fortieth s and that on a couple of them
We actually set up buffet in there
Mm
which worked reasonably well
Mm
I think one did it you know what I mean
Yeah
tart it up and whatever
Mm
Er m and what else worked well er m for a while we were doing the women's darts
And we had about three boards in here and we had a board in there
I mean there must be about seven boards in all
Right
Was that a competition was it
No it was a weekly thing
Because what they were doing they were going to individual pub s
Oh yeah
Which couldn't cope
Yeah
with it and th wha on their knock - o u t s and their cups and everything they
Yeah
wanted them all in one place
So
Aha
but er m there was a bit of jealousy in the la license es started getting a bit er er
Mm
because we're taking the trade away from them you know they would have obviously had
They were all the other pub s and the darts
Yeah
They'd have had a lot
A bit of competition from other place
Well at that stage we were talking to the men's darts secretary came along and was saying he'd be quite interested in in knocking up you know one of the L an cash i re matches or something
Oh
like that
It's a
Well it's the stage for it int it
Th thing is you can put it on there put it on sta you can er film it and bang it on the big screen over there
M hm
which is what I I in the I had Eric Bris tow and Maureen one night and I mean it was just little dart board in the corner but what I did was I had a big screen like that and I just got student television service just to film it live and just throw it straight back up on to the big
Yeah
on to the thing so you know it was like well it's better than being at the telly
I mean it's better
Mm
than
Watching that
because th on the telly they haven't got those
I mean I'm
Mm
amazed at the on the world champion ships they've only got those lighting up boards
That's right
haven't they
That's right yeah
You know and I instead of having I mean
Screen up
why they don't just put a screen up
Yeah
that beats me you know
They do other sport et cet era
See what I mean
Mm
Yeah
Well that's part of the course because we need to sort with Johnny's entertainment out with a roof
Yeah
Alright
They've got two or three
little leaks
What it is is the ventilation on the roof ventilation shaft s when the wind's driven it drives under and leaks through
And we get it in two or three places the toilets are are the key one
And you don't see with that
Roof til es are a fu bloody cost a fortune
Yeah so damn
I didn't bring the I'll I'll go and I'll go and get the key for that
No I'll let you see it may as well while you're here
You can see floor
What's the floor underneath the floor
Concrete
I think what what you mean
What is
the actual car it's just carpet
You see it was out in the probably is still out in the hall that one
Yeah
I mean closed now it
Mm
was open when Colin was there that time of the day
Yeah
You know you'd have ten they say
Yeah
ten if there was only ten people in they'd all be drinking six or seven
Yeah
pints
You haven't got a cold shelf in here
But I mean that wouldn't be
No
that's not that difficult to put in here
We'll get them
Yeah
Exactly
I think we'll be able to get them to put them in for us
No
Yeah
Oh we've gotta pay that one haven't we
To pay that one
I think so yeah
We've got two coming for ourselves but
Yeah
Yeah
we'll be able to get them off Gary I think yeah
And we'll be able to say look we want we want how man how many have you got behind there
Have you got cold shelves behind there
We've got one two threefour behind there
Right
So we could get a couple for here
Yeah
couldn't we
Yeah
And you're painting over that
I've gotta come and paint
I mean really if if you look fifteen thousand if you could spend fifteen thousand doing all this up
Ah yeah
and you could write off barrels you could still improve your barrel er your barrels a week int it
Oh yeah
Yeah
You need er you need to
Definitely
Yeah
Oh yeah
And you don't need say you don't need you only need like one private function a week
And promotions you know Malibu promotion night where the
Do promotions that's right
Yeah
And yo and your er see what I mean about this are a up here I mean it's not a bad thingy
No
No I mean I don't think
Just time to sit and have a drink and all that
Well
I mean if you wanted you can use the big screen
You see cos we put it that position cos er the only dead part of the club is just literally
Yeah
in the corner
O the other way you can see the screen from everywhere
Er m
I mean how much do you reckon it'll cost
If we said ou the carpet we said well a certain are a of the carpet wants
Yeah
Er m
I mean it's quite a big floor are a when you look at it
How much did you say
Yeah probably
in all your night clubs and what did you say they do a
We'll nothing we'll won't be able to paint the floor and put the carpets down on
I mean I
that floor
I would have thought to be honest I would have thought you don't need any of that are a
No
carpet ed
Just to probably very ends of
Don't you you want your raised are a this
You want your two raised areas carpet ed
Er by by the bar would you say it no not right in front
you know have that
Yeah
running to about three foot back
Yeah
Yeah that
Well
but you don't really want it up to the bar if you're going to get
No I'm saying that
you go right up to the bar
Yeah
you want it up to
See if you put artists on and you have this are a as some kind of without carpet on
Mm
in some ways you haven't put you can actually be you know dancing on this are a
I meant ha that's the problem we got at the moment
Yeah
On Mary's do what we did I put soul machine over here where the screen was
Yeah
so people could dance on the er on the actual dance floor if they wanted
Er m I mean it's not ideal but it really it worked
It w or even providing you haven't got a lot of if you've only got about a hundred people it's not too bad that cos it it also creates a bit more atmosphere
But it's a better i it's not a bad designed place in a sense that that I mean it's a reasonable size room
Mm
and you ca and three hundred people er you can take three hundred quite
Yeah
easily I mean you know we've had four fives hundred in
Mm
You can take three hundred quite easily
But the er m the other thing about it is if you have a hundred people in it can be so also be a good atmosphere you know
Mm
Yet i it's not one of those rooms where if
No
you only get a hu yo you're struggling if you've only a got a hundred
Yeah
Er mwhat I'm I've just arranged somebody to redo our speaker s y s te our original system with t annoys we blew our t annoys speakers and I didn't bother getting them replaced because we were going for a rock crowd so we just used Bernie and Nigel
Mm
P A there
Yeah
What I've got is I've got four of these directional speakers there's two up and two on here and then two big bass ones which sit on a floor back there
And so it's very loud on the dance floor but you can actually talk out out here
Mm
Which I thought we need to redo if we're gonna get private bookings
Yeah
Cos the one thing you always get when you've got a mixture of people I mean all th i this needs recovering basically as well
Yeah
But I mean that's not a big job it's just
No
re re li no ing it basically
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Filling the smoke
Smoke machine
up
Yeah you got a smoke machine wewewe would set in little in a hole in the back
And all of these air conditioning valve s are on
Yeah
Mm
Actually I'm having the a th I mean I can get I'm getting our system back in operation
It it was gonna cost me a thousand but I've done a deal with a guy who'd got stuck with some in Manchester so it's gonna cost me five hundred which I'm getting done this Friday
Er m to put a satellite system to put a satellite in would be three hundred quid in total
Yeah
So I mean it's that's only one that's only one good 'un good night using it inn it a year
Pays for that
Yo you're light the er ceiling could you not get away with covering the get the lights a colour blue
And er and you know tidying up ceiling obviously
Right
I mean there's lots of bits and pieces you need for a
I mean if you just cover all the areas that were really
Yeah
bader I reckon I says well what do you think yourself in in in
Well the the big the single biggest cost is is what we do with this a carpet are a
Mm
That's our single biggest cost cos as I say I had three quotes in total and they were all sort of between thirteen and twenty three
Yeah
Thousand
Yeah
But that's having said that that's to carpet all this are a
Yeah
that back are a I've just taken you through that the staircase and the corridors out there
I mean that's the carpet ev I just said like I wanted a quote to carpet
Mm
everywhere
Er m what we were doing is i what it was for was for for prospective buyers they wanted er m a justification for
Yeah
Yeah
the money they were gonna spend
I mean they wouldn't have spent that money
But they wanted written quotes for a justification more or less
Do you think it's better being like this
Looking there or is it better sort of clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space and
Well it's quite it's a reasonable size
I know it's a fair size but
It's a fair size dancing
you know
space actually I mean you get about a hundred people on here it's it's it's alright
In fact the in fact it's i at times it's too big
That's my one I don't know how you'd ever get over it but that's my one criticism of the thing is that sometimes when you walk in it's the first thing that hits you and unless people are dancing it creates a cold atmosphere
Yeah
Er m
I mean if you've got your group on there's nothing better than having your floor there and are dancing on the floor at at in front of the group kind of thing like
Yeahbut I mean a a if you have any
anything like a a a group takes all of this
Yeah
If you have a
That's right
a main group up you know
Yeah
you're struggling to get
But then if you did this floor space like
Yeah
we said
Oh yeah
Yeah
I mean I I actually don't think you need carpet on I mean I I don't
Oh no
think I don't think you need any of this carpet to be honest
black would that look nice
Black carpet
I dunno
Ah cos Peter was saying I dunno I dunno what the black
Don't have to be black you just want you want something that er I don't know really you'd have to think about it wouldn't you
Mm
Yeah
Oh yeah
Could do with probably somebody who knows what they're doing on it
You want the carpet are a full of seating
Actually one thing Barry
Yeah
don't you
That's right
Give it a bit of warmth when they're sitting right
Yeah
down
the are a
That's one thing Ben said though which was quite useful he said get some people down pick their brains
Mm
You know let them come down and give a quote
Mm
for whatever you're looking at
Mm
and pick what they thought was the best thing you could do and then don't don't tell you but get them made
Yeah
You know and like
That's right
I say it these guys are working on this all the time
I mean on a normal night it's the raised areas fill up with people seated
Yeah
This area's er everybody's stood around
Yeah
I mean i i it's a while before these chairs are the they're always the last ones these to sit
Yeah
down cos you're in the middle of the thorough fare
You know i i you need to be full to fill up that are a because well you know yourself people like to stand around the bar don't they
Mm
Oh
That's right yeah
So I mean all you do is get I mean this and this has been down well it's obviously it's been down since it opened now I can't remember when Brewer actually opened
Mm
but it must be seven years ago
If we've been
Nearly seven or eight year ago weren't
Yeah
it
I mean we've been in three
Yeah it'll be about eight eight year ago
It was closed for a
I wonder
year
I wonder how ma had to to town I come down from across the town
I don't know
It's getting the steam roller up that worries me
Well you
the time after don't it
Mm
Well I mean I don't know how to find the other one out
You only have to paint the dance floor on then don't you
I wonder how much it would cost the town like
I know it sounds silly but I say the silly things like that are the ones that sometimes are the
Mm
ones that are took seriously
But like you say the floor can stand it and there's nice little corner or whatever int there
I don't know
That was rather a cheek i est thing to do
Mm
I mean a er a you see ou a good a good looking hard wearing wo li no
Yeah
might not
Yeah
go a miss
Cos then you can just just mop it down brush it or whatever you don't even
Yeah
need to bother vacuum ing which takes time is a pain in the neck and you can never get a vacuum that's any good anyway
And plugs
they might look er you know they look cheap y or
No
sort of
But you
li no being
No they do but you can get good ones now can't you
Ah yeah
I mean you can get ones that look like I just wonder whether you can get ones that look like sort of parquet floors almost
I've seen these industrial companies and he said look have you got any er of your older stuff
What's that
Because Polly 's got a it was at the front of the bar it's quite a heavy duty thing int it that
Mm
It'll take fag burns and you want something that's not gonna that's like that's got li like that crystal e y stuff
Mm
inn it
And and it's non - s l i p
Yeahthat's er that's good
That's the stuff
Mm
you
It's a non - s l i p stuff
want but I would have thought that'll be quite dear won't it
You know that kind with all the grit
Yeah I know
I like that
in it
I wonder if you went to the industrial companies and said look have you got a a a a big lot of something and
Yeah well that'll be alright
You know
Well doj a er I mean er is it Mar nes do that floor covering
Yeah but that was for carpets was it i isisis that do they do the floor covering s there
Yeah
Course it's still
Or is it Store y s or
Yeah
Yeah they do the floor covering
Find out
Yes
I think we'll just work out
I've never been to that have you
That that'll be that and a and a lick of paint
Yeah
and then you're you're half way there
Th
Yeah
Oh yeah
Yo your main job is to see th
I mean
see the bar open and
th yeah
I mean th the the other thing is we need we need it we need it recovered in something that's but I mean that's not a massive job and we and we and I want the toilet trough that sort of thing
Yeah all that sort of thing
What's the ladies like
The ladies are alright
Yeah they're alright
Don't need I mean if we get somebody in to do that we'd have somebody in do little bits of repairs here and there but generally it's alright
I'll show you
See there's a tremendous amount of wasted space there
Mm
And Jean's corridor
Jean's corridor
I resume see if the places are
It and we had ninety on it on Saturday
Bus dr i bus driver nearly we nearly hit the the thing nearly keel ed over cos he didn't realize how many he'd got upstairs and he went round the bend and it started to go
And then cos you're not supposed to stand up upstairs
See the crack int bog
Yeah
I think it's got a bit damaged on Saturday then he put him back
Supposed to lift base
But er generally needs
Oh I know
Yeah
Aye
The trouble is toilets are toilets and they don't and they
Oh aye
get damaged I mean you just have to keep bloody working on them I
That's nice in the toilet
Yeah take them in
That's right mate
As I say it needs cleaning up of graffiti and a little bit of adjustment and
Yeah
This is the problem er le
Yeah
leaking roof
Cos these bloody til es are expensive
Yeah
They keep getting damaged and collapsing and of course it's part of the fire protection as well so
You've got to be er
Yo they've got you know yo you're not supposed to have damaged ones and we you know for an inspection we have to get th we'd have to oh
Yeah
change all these
Well what about what what who's responsible
Is it John is
John is
Yeahbut I mean you know at the moment we've not been pushing anything till
No
I mean everything's sorted out then I will
Yeah
I think what it probably needs is just a guard round the top ventilation things
Yeah
cos a they're open and the wind drives under it
Well it and shut up to there with and that you can
Ah yeah
try them holes
Yeah
in there
Yeah
with special sealer
But I mean
That's right
That's right
That's what I mean and we'll be alright
See this is er that goes along here
But what I wanna do is trough this and bury these pipes
Yeah
Cos er you just get damage all the time in here
And I got Tony coming to do these now
Yeah
Put these under there
Somebody's pulled the sink off
Mind you if you do that your only problem then is your roof int you
Yeah
You just
Yeah
You just put a lick of paint again wo your til in g's awful int it
Yeah
But
I mean
Yeah
It's all there
Well if you in you can see the diff I mean you've got what seven urinals there
But if you troughed all in an L
Yeah
I mean you'd take could take twenty guys stood there
I mean damage is being done say you have got seven guys there stood what's
Mm
the other one doing I think can can pull
Yeah
this off
Yeah
I know
So they've nothing better to do
You got them on trough then they're saying alright we'll do it somewhere else
Yeah
Then the longer you got them in here they're likely
That's right
to
That's right
There's enough here for a trough
Oh aye
Well I dunno it's go it's got I was showing th I was showing the licensing people round er m the inspection of Jean we Jean wasn't here we were looking round and fire brigade and that were there and inspection we turned round and all written across is Jean is a fucking fat cow
Alright
I mean I mean you tried not to laugh
we tried desperately to avoid looking at her right
And the environmental health guy there and all
Well they probably thought you wrote it
Yeah
Looks like they're not getting on
This was a good idea of Johnny's which they did which did before was this corridor these lights up here that one when it's re - d o i n g b u t there's onetwothreefourfive six and they framed a large advertising poster
Mm
Mm
And so like hundred quid a year
Yeah
for
Yeah
For putting it
It could be a
out
I mean it's six hundred quid for doing nothing inn it
That's right
Six is it
Oh
Er m you know er I can't remember who they are but it wasn't clientele but I mean we could you know we could
Yeah
look around for the relevant er
That's right
And how much of this stuff's down
I mean this'll have been down I ohwon't be able to get as much wear
Yeah
This is this is this is
original as far as I know
Did you lay that yourself
Yeah
A little bit
Do they just seem to stick on tap or is it a row
Nonono this is a row
A row
Yeah
The stuff that's that's the stuff you want
This is it is not the similar stuff like we've got in the kitchen upstairs
No
No
That rug stuff
It is er it's er
Mm
a actually it is like that stuff
But it's different
It wasn't here was it
Same
No
sort of thing
No
Maybe that's the type of thing you want on the floor
I reckon that is
That is it
In there
Make do some more er extend the er er er er parquet floor ing are a to give you more dance room
An and and round the other areas which
Up here
and keep the carpet on the high seating areas
Oh aye
Yeah
I think it's better up there
Oh yeah
Aye but it wouldn't cost very much to carpet those two areas
No
I think you do you know do something
Yeah
Yeah
a little bit better but I mean
but it you just need something that's ro that's hard wearing and
And practical really isn't it
you know
As I say people aren't going in in there to look at oh what a pretty carpet you've got
No
Oh no
As long as it's as long as it it's warm
Well if you remember most of the time the lights are off
Yeah
It's only to create an impression when you're doing it in the day time
Yeah
That's right
I mean I don't know whether you've thought any more about that idea that Colin had but I mean I don't know yo cos you haven't said you do you haven't really looked round it
No that's right you know the the the only thing we've we've actually gonna trying to get that into a the bar is er se greg ate
Perhaps er Jean's left actually
This is this was the the cloak room and what we were what we were intending doing originally
is turn it into an office
Mm
I mean we haven't done so far but we that's what but this is stuff we got about hundred
Oh yeah
and fifty quid for two massive rolls like this
Mm
Well that's well that's what not ba bad is it for those int
Mm
it
Yeah
I mean that's what Jean's talking about getting
Mm
That's alright int it
Oh to but that will fit is a bit
Well er
bit more thick ness than I hope der but if it's sat on top of there and on top of what's on
On top of what's on
Right
I don't know whether they were actually sitting right where the be v el or whatever
I know this sort of stuff is we had similar to when I worked in the shop er used to he had three quarters of this guy come round in a van or whatever back of a van
Yeah
and he laid it himself
Mm
and by the entrance and whatever er
I think you'd have to get a professional carpet
So
layer just just to make certain
Sum mat like that really is is obviously
Yeah
And it's just stuck on int it
Yeah
I mean i er I I spent as I say
spent the best part of the year working in here sort of nine to five type thing and it's mind walking down that bottom end without any ar without any natural light
Mm
Mm
That little office you know so I said to Jean you know well let's turn this into an office
Yeah
basically
Er m
No I can did you have a cloak room then
Or did you
No
I mean we u when we when we use whe the the rave used this as a cloak room
Er m but I mean there are there are other areas you can use
Mm
And you can use you could use past that er m cos that's the other thing I haven't shown you is is this is all ours as well down the bottom end
Er m and that's the other thing about having having sort of a lot of people thinking it having having it as a sort of rock club at night they they regard it as their own sort of thing
Oh right
I mean so when we do have to do re decoration we just gotta let the volunteers in
Yeah
Left a a crate of P il s for them and carry on painting everything
Right this is er that's the s no ok er next door
Next door
Yeah
It's alright I'll knock it off
You don't need to knock connect it through
That's the garden sign which blew off in the gale s before Christmas and landed on Uri 's car
Er m
What you didn't do it
Yes
That's Breakers in there is it
That's Breakers in there
Er m
Is this an entrance as well
It can be
Down the bottom that just goes out to the bottom and there's a back
Yeah
er m
Yeah
I see that there
And it's got a sign over the
Yeah
back with a light if you
Yeah I've seen that yeah
want it cos we were you know we were thinking i we wanted to leave ourselves that option
I mean we were thinking about like the Sunday markets and things
Yeah
You know ut i liz ing except it's a long drag for people but but you
Mm
know anyway
Cleaner's room two dressing rooms and a toilet
I mean they're dressing rooms or offices or whatever you want basically I mean
What about there
Ye er that's er this is just a cleaner's cleaner's cum store room you know the usual
Mm
crap
Er m I don't know whether these are open
I'll give you a key
Keep them all locked
You'll find
Er
This is for changing rooms
So this is a
Yeah
there casual act
I mean we cos we've
Sort of
not been putting on any loud music recently I've not had I'll stretch it out a little bit but er m you know we had a heater in here and er record player and er ra er radio and that
Yeah
I mean it's a got extra padding on
Well that's right I mean you know it it when when it was er m oh what's that cook who had
Found the place
er tt he's now got that place in Lancaster the er what was the Trade and Labour club in Lancaster
Oh
Ton Peter
Yeah Peter when he had i the had er double bed in there with bolts on the inside of the door
Did he
Yeah
Is he
People have often called
They say there's
Cos Caesar s are in there now
Oh are they
Yeah
Oh
Doesn't
Yeah
surprise me
You'll be getting what is it in they can't open now they've lost the er they've lost some of er they've lost some sort of
Yeah I know but it's it's it's sum mat
Aye
Right
So that's round it
So the easiest thing really is obviously is if I get the thing sorted out and then turn it
Yep
around and er we've had a word with Ellie l this morning
Mm
Yeah
Er m they they're quite happy with with all that sort of stuff
Yeah
They're gonna come up are you free on F r i Thursday afternoon at four o'clock
Thursday's a busy day for us really
Five o'clock 's finebut four o'clock 's probably
But Ith th they're actually supposed to get Friday rush
Mm
and then you really should with the staff we've
Yeah
got
So
Er
cos unless we're going to get it straight but it just all comes in like this time of year and just comes and let us in
I mean
What so so ba as la as towards five o'clock as as possible
If we got here if we got if we got to fa wherever you wanted to meet where do you want to meet
Well I'd rather I'd
Come down to us
I'd rather ma come down to you to be honest
Well if you come down to us so
Cos then Mike ought to see your operation as
Yeah
well you see so
If you bring him down about
Yeah
you know half four to five
Half four
we'll be
You'll get the idea
we'll be getting on top
Alright
then you know
Okay
We're usually done by five you know so there's
Yeah
no problem
Make by five
Yeah
o'clock
Yeah
Five o'clock
Yeah
I think the biggest thing really is just like they say is how much you can get that done for and get the roof ing done that's gotta be done
Yeah
Er
Yeah
some paper them toilets cos er I'm you know I say from our our both side is something that's er I mean everybody's looking purely from and return sales
All you're looking at is for an in come an in come from it and er I reckon can do very well
What do you what you think of that bar are a Barry
Do you think it could be inclined to be
Er the top one
as a drinking are a
Yeah
U yeah I mean I
during the day
yeah well it was it was what I wanted to it was what I wanted to it was wanted to do in it i ally I mean but then you have like so many ideas that
Yeah
you know you can't do them all in that sense but if you had somebody somebody like Colin might be able to
Cos you only need you only need him to drag sort of fifteen twenty people in in it i ally
And five ten of them
And they'll all they'll all be drinkers
Yeah
But I mean sa ta so there's an at little atmosphere there anyway
Yeah
er m and then you can I mean well it gives you the opportunity to you know bang in a bloody jazz band or whatever you wanna do in there somewhere
Yeah
and and build it up like that
As you said they haven't actually you know it'd be if you could get some sort of portable
Screening
screen that'd just shut it off
Mm
So people don't feel as though they're sat in a wide a i wide open
No I know yeah
Yeahthat's right
you know
Er m
Well you ca you ca you can get that
You can get you can do something
But yeah
can't you
Yeah
Like you say if you get your satellite T V in there
Yeah
you know you can
Yeah
just make it a cosy little bar where you can
Yeah
That's right
It won't cost any to give it a go would it
No
If Colin 's if Colin 's up for it it wouldn't at all
I mean it needs to perhaps perhaps they can do something for the first couple
Oh yeah need some sort of er
Yeah
idea to get it going and get it off the ground even if you you put your beer on at well I just thought of couple B odd ing tons put their they're they're gonna put their they're gonna put there's at a pound a pint
Mm
You know just to attract some people you know approach the brewery say look what about a few keg
And if you get two or three keg put that money into free stock you know
Yeah
Say you
Cleaner's not the cleaner's not done behind here yet
If you open it up if you do get it open and advertise it at B odd ing tons a pound a pint get them straight to come in
You're not making a fortune at first but once you get it going
Mm
You said about traditional
The only other thing is the
Depends where your money is really
Whe whe where's your cellar
Right underneath
Right at the bottom
Yeahbut if if you
How big's your fire exit entrance
the fire exit
You could put it behind you could feed it through the wall behind to where that
Yeah
spacious room is where all your chairs are couldn't you
Yeah
We probably could yeah
Th well it's no it's not quite the back
how would you get in there
Yeahthat's the that's the thing I was
Well it's got it's a bit dry this
I know
It's a bloody yeah
You can still
It's fucking ridiculous
Er m cos you'd tell the brewery wouldn't you
The only other thing to do is is do what er er we did at one time and just get a bright beer and open it up and er and then pull it
And have it
I know
Now there's a thought
It er you'd have problem with er
But would you
Depends tha I don't know what sort of draw you can put on that pump here
They're getting smart
But I wanna do what the Three Miners do in Lancaster don't they
That's that er that's a traditional beer inn it
Yeah
That's right yeah
they gotta but he's knocking it straight
Yeah
down aren't they
It's just getting it up here
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah very strong lad this
You might have to do it later
Can I look at the telly
Yeah course you can
I was gonna
It's in here
suggest that
Up here and then get
Ohoh that's my order for Thursday
Oh right
Have you got line cleaner
Yeah
Mm
Yeah
That's put a
A fair int it doing
The bar the baron the bar
The bar's there I mean I was thinking you had your stool painted that white on
Yeah
or a red a deep
Oh yeah
sort of red behind the bar maybe get a couple more like that
Yeah a lick of paint and and
Oh yeah
and and that you know and you can
And then we'll fill the shelves up
That's right
All all one thing we haven't discussed is is these ar these ar r ears int it that we've got
This the rates
Yeah
is the biggest one int it
Right
Right
Now I don't know if it's worth asking
Well I could
council to if you could like lump it with the next year 's
El e Ellie l Ellie l said that er they could probably twist the council's arm
What's that for Barry
Well this you know we're on about this money
Yes
well there is there is ba bad debts you know which er
Yeah
I don't know if I've got them here
How much is that for
Well it was er it was about
Twenty two
here we are that's it er it's rent which we we're gonna clear
Mm
there's twelve for rates and the twelve and other two's ours which we're we
Yeah
can we can stand on that
Mm
You've got you've got like water rate twelve hundred er rates twelve but er what we could try to do is approach them and see if we can lump it in with this year and that obviously have to pay higher
I mean some of it is is the next two month anyway er m
Yeah
But we we'd usually have no
but
rents er we've no er we've lease to pay back have we or ow t like that
Oh and the other the other thing isisis by asking Fred for
To pay
That's right
But even so then ask Fred on the long term would be ideal
Er the biggest thing is for us is is making payable for you
Yeah
I mean
At first
we've not gone any further with this F re with Fred because
No
we're just leaving it so we sort ourselves out first on on how
Yes
we feel happy with it and
Yeah
and whe how how whether you want Fred involved in in what way
Well it's really that's needed be here you know if we ca
Yeah
if we can
And
if we can resolve it with cos then you're getting sum mat on a different style of thinking to that you know I know Fred doesn't wanna be involved but then you've always got somebody well we'll have to go and see Fred first
Mm
And and I don't know
Yeah you could work it
Go see Fred and he's probably got a few more pounds ready available than
Yeah
than we have
Oh yeah
You know that's the er
That's right
bit difficult
Yeah
And that's your er cos er personally
Oh I've got the
I'll say that it's not
accounts in various off - s h o r e islands and and
Yeah
black bin liners in his back garden
If we can sort him out with rates and I don't know
If he can o if we can offset if we can use all if he'll out time type of thing
Mm
with that
Yeah
er m the oh er
You've gotta put an offer in and pay it so much a month haven't you or something and and and get it paid off over a period of time
And then you can do it without Fred and really with Fred is is at the end of day you could pro proof pay load could go back to yourself and I I E and ourselves but by having him that other cut you're gonna be saying well it's all a bit more than your share
I mean from my point of view I don't think he's ever
I don't think Fred 'd be looking for anything as a return
No
Not in the sh or
I'd be quite happy to come
not in the short term
Not in the short term
you get tucked into it and obviously there we'll keep it sort of low profile
But giving it a good clean out and getting
Mm
it d us painted behind the things whatever come on Sunday or whatever and just say that you might
In return yeah
Just take a
quite keen just to sort of get
Mm
muck ed into it
Mm
just to save money
See if you can get
but as long as I say the biggest thing from my point er is not to so lose money if you can do from where we're going
No
And use the fifteen grand to its best image in the way that you feel then you can turn round and run a club so it can get people in
Mm
And we can get the lighting in
Because that's what your best thing is
Mm
you've got the ideas and th the motions
Mm
And for yourself and what we don't wanna do is like I say is spend money that is just gonna disappear and say shit
We haven't really improved the pub 's barrel age if goes away
No
I mean th the other aspect of the of the f if the other aspect of the the brewery and me that I was talking about er I'm thinking about is that we we could do with you know okay those th those figures are I mean unless they're really realistic it's gonna be you know six months or so
Mm
before we start getting up to the kind of figures where we can actually see a you know
Yeah
a profit each week
Mm
a a a reasonably substantial profit I mean
That's right yeah
so with the best will in the world it's going to be six months so let's so we need a little of breathing space
Yeah
on that six months
Now er er obviously if if we can if we can get the money off the brewery cos you know if we can get a little bit more
That's right yes
than we actually need to spend that that
Yeah
enables us to you know have that breathing space er m so we can start
Well what what we can you know I say he's offering us this fifteen unsecured if we can mind you
Yeah
I don't know if we can squeeze any more or what
I reckon
but but you know if say well look you know we could do with twenty five and he turns round and he might say well you know yo he might say no
Mm
but we know we've got fifteen just to get us
Yeah
going
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
What he said then is look you know hey he's all you're saying really
is ah if your barrel age is there then what we do is buy five or six barrels from More cam be Bay Wines
Yeah
You can soon get rid of those
You can say More cam be Bay Wines and buy all his
Mm
cos what I I just said to him I said look I says a er sometimes I says it's an awkward time drop for us
Says well we'll get it delivered here you know only without
Yeah well that's
invoice
That's what we wanted inn it
Well what we do what we use
What we do is buy it barrel led and and
Yeah
get out be
Yeah
More cam be Bay License form
Barrel or keg
Because we ca we can live on thirty pound on barrel can't we
I think we can do
I'd like you to just purely myself I'm not saying I'm right and you're not right and people like
Mm
my o my own personal view is if we just pay the fifteen and it's sort of off in there straight away and then spend but not to sort of say well you can spend it and update it can't you
But spend what we feel is gonna make the club
Mm
better image like you say
Mm
somebody comes to look at it just for a view I mean I say I I'm quite happy coming like I said th if you motion behind there make the bar present able we'll fill it out with stock then that'll look better
Yeah
but if we do display
Put more stock in
we've got a load
Yeah
of tent cards and display things
Yeah
that could decorate that
Yeah
You know and we'll do it ourselves I say I mean what you want Barry is like wanna keep it low profile
Mm
But we've both got time to sort I say somebody we'd enjoy doing it
Because wewewe either do it ourselves and spend
Before the cricket season
Yeah
Yeah
I mean America are getting a private cup for here
I mean if you just e mu l sion
Yeah
that the red bits into red and got the so I say nice sort of tent cards and and got a few firms I mean firms and come on in and do your display you know
Yeah
and your promotions and
Yeah
That's something we will we will be able to do is you know is
Yeah
I mean things like what I want on desperately quickly is Rebel Yell cos they're spending a fortune in the rockwell all our punters all know it
I mean you go down in London it's the it's just like Rebel Yell everywhere but it's all heavy rock so
Yeah
I mean it's just perfect for that but I know they do a display unit and things like
Yeah
that
But I mean I have to go
Well that's all it wants
through I have to go through Michelin to get that
Yeah well we'll you won't know you'll be
You might do
No no I'll be
We
That's what I mean according to Tracey on
You could of told me Tracey 's on
Yeah that bitch
Didn't mention
He said
It was er one bottle free buy two and get a bottle free and plus display unit you see
Yeah
and I said well I want it on but he said you'll have to go for this
Oh course
Said alright so I filled out a bloody form and I went to Michelin s they knew nothing about it and they hadn't got it displayed either
Yeah
And this was like three weeks later it wasn't
Mm
you know cos I said
Oh yeah
I wanted to begin with that week
But that mean I mean that's
Yeah
examples handfuls of it you know
Oh yes you could pay for that
I think we should be able to get some proper er box coolers in here off the
M hm mm
you know these these er lift down ones you know
Mm mm
you can put all your cans in and
Mm
get you know get them in and say and say look yo well you're gonna save money on the pints well give us four box coolers for a year and you
Mm
know which style I mean
Mm
Yeah
Yeah I know
The big ones
Do all wine coolers
Yeah
as well don't
Yeah
they
Don't do a lot of wine you know
No but if you only for your functions and
Yeah
Well true
That's kind of true yeah
I mean we went through we went through nearly a case of one point fives at Mary's party
Le ib frau mil c h
I mean it we had
I mean I reckon
we had to
or do you want to
Yeah
how do you functions
Nine eight er nine er one point fives
Your shoe 's just fallen off Barry
Yeah I know
I didn't think he was get there
Er
Get a few P il s ' cabinets
You could ge
off them
It's it's great
Yeah I know
The staff can't wander off you see on a night
Can't sneak off at back cos they
Oh yeah
move
I know
They're stood here like this
They could do your function thing
Have your function here and get a bottle of champagne free kind of thing or whatever your with your parties
Something I mean we can work that in the price or whatever
Yeah
you know
I me another thing we really need to aller you see when I was working at it and when we were doing it all the time
Yeah
er you were using your own contacts
Well that's right
like
Yeah
Yeah
you know mate of mine had got his son at bloody public and wants one of these posh public school type all night parties so we had one of those and you know and er
I say like I say I just just red er paint sum mat like these are white these and just go down on the red and just up there and just up here just get your display s
Yeah
and your bar 'll look ten times better
Yeah
I tell I mean ju okay forgetting the carpet at the moment it's it'll cost it'll cost about a grand to get the toilets all done up
Yeah
three hundred quid for satellite in er m I need these shutters repairing cos they're
Yeah
knack e red
And and odds
You need it all
and so ds and III'd like to buy a couple of lighting effects but I mean
Yeah
you're only talking about a co you know a few hundred quid for that
Let's just choose I know you can't change
There is
what the there
But as I say
No you can't
you know
Yeah
get get a
just er
cooler
the basis of this fifteen grand is using the fifteen grand but like we can see you using that
I'd like to look at shutter ing that are a if we are gonna do your
Yeah
Yeah
I will well
But we can't
I I I reckon
it
that could pay for itself if Colin got in so you'll do that one get Colin to pay for it
Colin 's aw a I think he's he's taking kids away for camping and things all next week but I'll I'll try
You need
I can say to him that about it
yo for a start you need those two th these end two you need b li you need blinds on because you can't utilize the screen in the summer without these I mean we got we got blinds for all those windows I mean
Mm
they're all all they are are they're p ho photographic you know when you have blackouts and er you know the
Yeah
they're that kind of mat
Yeah I know what you mean
white material they're just white but they they a total black out which they use on the rave nights
I mean I do I think the view is quite nice certainly if you got a summer it's
Oh well yeah
quite a pleasant evening
See my idea originally was that cos it comes back from when I used to go in the in the Blue Anchor in Lancaster after work I mean we had everybody in there
We had like market traders in there managers of Marks and Spencer s and Woo lies
Yeah
and you know building societies insurance companies and everybody's i the rounds were like twenty five quid a time but everybody's only drinking halves cos you could never
That's right
you know so just half a g ui but it it got that but once they changed the opening hours do you remember when they brought in six
Yeah
o'clock
Yeah
It destroyed all that
Yeah
And then er they brought it back and then they started doing to quarter to six but it still wasn't good enough cos you can't you can't have all these people in suits and brief cases stood outside a pub for quarter of an hour waiting for it open you know
No
I mean it wasn't good
That's right
for their image
No no
So
Suit off
Oh no they're your
So it like killed that
But I'm sure there's I'm sure there's that kind of trade for you know a sort of a Bic B i ro runner type you know that kind of well our age group you know
Yeah
the sort of
Well that's it yeah
thirty to thirty to
Yeah
fifty age group
That's right
And and people want a drink after work and have a chat cos the
Yeah
it was a it was all business people and you're talking about
That's right
you know what it was like what things were and
Once you can get people in you know you gotta attract them in but once you get them in they'll
Yeah
be ev oh it's alright
Yeah
I quite like it
Got them into this place
Make it pleasant you know and have to do sum mat you know just to make it have to get nice mirrors up on wall and
I mean the wine bar
you know
in Lancaster did that happy hour didn't they
And that got
That's right
heaving
Yeah
with business people
That's what you wanna do
Like I say you know put put your B odd y s on at a
I bet that would be really interesting
pound a pint between
Yeah
five and seven
Ellie l's our discount because you know they're doing
No
It was great
Mm
I mean the biggest thing really I think my interest in all this to get secure trade from us
Mm
which we're gonna get and get your salary
You know because they're the few main things round here you're happy and you can feel that obviously you you'll be working for something
Yeah
I mean to be honest I've put in like twotwo years without any
Oh I know
Yeah I know
salary with this place
I mean I've been doing outside jobs to get you know I mean like doing festival s
and whatever else to get
Yeah
my money in
So the
Has an anybody come to you through the
and you're losing money if you're not if you're not seeing any return you're
No
you're going through the motions
No
I mean God you know if I've gotta go down to London for three days I'd rather do that cos it's gonna earn me two or three grand
Well we could set like you say and no you know and get it going and you make a salary
and and then if there's anything left e er between us and then that's all well
Yeah
and good
Yeah
We'rewe're not wanting a wage out of it or anything you know
We'll get it to the
Well you'll get it you'll get it from the turnover won't you
We we'rewe're quite we're quite pleased you know say well let's see if we can get it going and and make a success out of it
And also I mean if we turn over hundred thousand pound with you in a year you're gonna make some money out of that
That's right
Yeah
You know so it's
Yeah
er
Make a grand or sum mat out of that won't you
That's it yeah
If we're lucky
If you're lucky
The only th the only thing is is th is what we'll do the beer whether we're gonna have to connect it to the brewery or whether we can get it through ourselves I don't know
I would think you're probably gonna have committed to separate accounts
Yeah I'm not too bothered about that
But as I said
But if it's if it can be dropped at your place
Well that's it yeah
Because I mean er you can always say look I've got commitment s all over the place and actually be
Well I've tol I I sold them that
Yeah
I says I says he's go he can't lose his
Yeah
with you you've gotta get the rest of the stuff
Yeah
Yeah
As long as
See
we can
Well that
it doesn't it doesn't matter what barrel age you put through it but put as long as we know that er the fifteen thou it's gonna be written off at thirty pound a barrel so the sooner you you do it the sooner it's written off
Yeah
But also
Good
it also means we haven't got any that's an are a where we haven't got any re payments
I'll just have a look round there again Barry
Yeah okay
Do you wanna
Can I see the back
play with those figures again
Dunno
Before we get started doing it
Well yeah doing the cellar
Do you wanna have a look in the cellar now
Oh yeah
Okay
gonna have a look round the back is he
Yeah
I'm just I mean I reckon you could I dunno if you can just pull them in
Draw them up and we used to do the would be quicker
Oh ta
you're gonna be really talking about next week aren't you
It looks like it
Yeah if you can
Definitely
See not that easy
No
I'm just thinking of that exit there
This this is good
I mean if you put that
the nearest one
You mean it's a fire exit so that's the problem so you're not gonna be able to leave anything in it that would obstruct
But ah so this it's the actual fire exit for here int
Mm
it
Yeah
Mm
That leads downstairs don't it
Yeah
It goes out next to the cellar
I suppose like you say at nine thirty once the music starts no one 's gonna want to
Oh er if you put if you put if you put wrought iron gates gates decorated type of thing round there
Yeah
and then somebody stands there two fifty that's what I were thinking an admission from here
Mm
And and wrought iron it yeah you know
Well wrought iron 'd look it'd look quite good for the functions trade as well cos you can get
Yeah
the artificial plants up it
Mm
and whatever else
Yeah
when you do
Get climbing plants
Yeah
You can get it it will soon cover
Yeah
cover it actually
Yeah
Yeah
I mean close that are a down
And that that would do double job cos that would do the job of your blinds as well wouldn't it
Yeah
Yeah
And then they'll cause the atmosphere rather than
Mm
big open wide
Mm
club
Yeah
Mm
Get your wrought your gates there or something like that to be
Yeah
round the back which entrance would they come in
They wouldn't come in that end
Well all you do right you have gates
Well I mean
then they're open so that at half nine you close them there or at ten o'clock you close them there and you say when they come through if you're going out that
Yeah
way or whatever
Yeah
I mean I I think you just have to but
It's something that you've gotta be
You'd have to play it by ear I think
Yes
thinking ahead
Yeah
Yeah
You know you're thinking well
Let's
at first you could just wrought iron it round and and just give it that
As you say if somebody's been in there from bloody five o'clock and wants to stay till eleven
Well that's it
or twelve then fine let them
I mean I th I wouldn't I wouldn't mind that
No
you know I mean
So you could either come in half eight half nine or
That's right
You know
But really you know
Yeah
what you do
At half nine you put someone on the door here to take money anyone who comes in whether they come into here or go into there
Mm
anyone who's been drinking all afternoon if you want to er wander across
Yeah I mean what you what you'd have to be careful of is is sooner or later people'll catch on to
Yeah
coming in at quarter past nine
Yeah
Yeah
buying one extra drink and er m getting a you know cheaper than saving their selves two and a half quid then
pint they buy and if they buy five pints
Yeah
they can have a three er er a three pound voucher
Can you imagine Polly organizing that all
We're getting complicated aren't we
Why can't we do it to me cost effective
Torture
Complicating issues
I remember at the Uni when we used to give we used to put stamps on people you know
Yeah
for pass out s and that or anything
So does Broadway
and er I bloody I said I said in the end I've what we ought to do is lo p some part of their anatomy off like a little digit or something then we can prove they've been in
eventually after about two years when you get this sort of armless leg less cor
Oh oh
body oh he's a good customer
We'll let him in for free
He gets a free free ticket
Well it's like like a all you want to do is
That's what you get you just gotta stand or you went downstairs to another bar
Yeah th the trouble is you're
and got a stamp
you
and they would
you you're doing it in the same room
Yeah
aren't you
That's the
That is as well
But I I dunno I see it's not once you're u actually up here looking I think it's different when you're up here looking back as when you're over there looking up here
Yeah
It's not quite as cold and empty as
If it got going you'd probably use mo another another half of are a you know
Yeah yeah you want
you don't wanna close it off
But like you say maybe just just a bit of wrought
Yeah
ironwork
Yeah
I think so
to just
I think you do I think that would look good anyway and
Yeah
and it would also enable you to quickly and easily do something on the er m on the on the private functions night to make it look different
Mm
I mean I wouldn't suggest putting
plants up and everything for our normal you know rock nights I mean we just have the wrought iron up and whatever but
I mean with them sort of then
Yeah
once you got er m tied into these you can
Oh yeah
do whatever to the thing
Yeah
But it would give you affect
That's right
I mean those are just we just went out and chuck ed a few fucking trees down
They're not real then Barry
No the trees are the er things tied on to them aren't
Oh
But er
Yeah
I think it's quite actually it needs a bit of character
I mean that'll cover
Yeah
if you did that in quite a few places
Yeah
throughout the room it would cover your cracks and your holes
Ye
and your your
I mean what we in it i ally wanted to do with all this was cover this whole are a in in greener y and have this as a sort of restaurant ta type
Mm
I mean again it's ideas when you're sat
It's ideas
planning before you've actually moved in and get
It is
Yeah yeahthat's right
and get and thenthen you start
that's that's the other thing when there's only two of you involved and you we were opening for that first sort of eighteen months fivesix days a week just keeping on top of a day to day business doesn't allow you to sit back
No I know that
and expand it and whereas you know that that's one are a that'd be great with having yo your involvement
Yeah
that you go in and say well you know
It sounds like this sort of thing
Yeah
When did you paint all this green
It was when I was working for Walt Disney so it'll be two years ago
Two years
Yeah
ago
I was over in Bel fast and I came back and it were green
It was al r i it's it's actually lasted reasonably well considering it hadn't been
Yeah
for two years
Yeah
But again it was all done it was all literally done in a weekend
Yeah
It was like a virtually an all night blitz job and so bits of it you know it wasn't like totally completed you know you've got and as Sco use was doing some of it it was er the paint work leaves something to be desired in areas
Something there Barry little bit in there look
Just coming down a little bit
They just need brushing back up
It's got a few you've got the
Not a problem
roof repaired haven't you
This
Yeah
The heating 's very efficient as well
It's very hot gas heating
Yes
Er m
They did do it like you say it was more or less just covering for itself now and then use
Mm
you build up up and up don't you
Yeah
So
Yes
Let us have a look at cellar and then we'll d'ya wanna and then we'll
Yeah
then we can say we've to looked at everything and then we know where you know
Yeah
Okay
and then we can er we can start you know we can at least we can say look we've got fifteen grand coming in and th it
Yeah
But we need a full
Yeah
I mean we can we can start by we I mean we can get people set up for doing things from the first of March can't we
Yeah
The little bits and pieces that we talked about
Well we well we we can start if you wanna start with the
Or we can think about doing something about
Yes
this
We can start giving it a lick of paint if you wanna start giving it a lick of paint
You see now the more you think about it I mean the more you you don't actually use this
No
very much
I mean you look at it if everybody was seated in this are a that could be seated I mean you're only talking about bloody
I
thirty people
I don't think it's too bad actually
I don't think the car pet's too bad at all really
Well th there's areas I mean
Yeah
tha the lic en s
Oh yeah
the licensing people would pull us up on that
Yeah
if they came
But maybe if you could cut it off from there
That's what I mean you gotta and then do it clear it and then clear all that
Mm
and just left that are a
Clear all that
and they're obviously they're gonna say
Come right up to the right up to bar really aren't you
Yeah
I mean th th er the other thing psychologically is it's you know
Blue R hap sody
Blue R hap sody
If you wanted to cha if you want to change it slightly you've got a problem
You know I think it I think it's something that you can say well you know that'd be one of our objective s
Mm
once we get it going but le
Mm
alright we we've got
Yeah
a few bob in the kitty
Right
let's or we can go to brewery for another five grand we'll do the carpet
Mm
now
I reckon the first thing really is is get your salary
Mm
Get your salary that you feel that I'm doing this and I'm getting it right
Mm
Is that the right sort of if our I mean from our objective is to get more sales
Yeah
right now
That's right
That's right
And we've gotta
That's right
manipulate people to say wellhow do we get them drink more
And you say like five pound a head when they they come in
How bad's the seating though
Sit there till
Is it is it that bad
It's it's if it needs doing
Oh it needs doing does it
You know
If you've got a guy gathered I'm not saying try but if you got somebody who who did the job and gathered it in like they would do
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah
But it i
An up holster
It's a perpetual patching up job at the moment
Yeah
Yeah
Because because it is only patched up it's
Yeah
it create more problems o you know cos people stand on it and
Get an up holster er just to come and tidy it up
Yeah
and fill in where there's been
Yeah
some damage done
Yeahthat's right
I mean there's
Just just tart it up really
There's a bit of structural damage to the support
Yeah
and things like that that start the seating going and things
Right
Okay
Oh this this actual stuff anyway we'll go we're putting that with that is alright to that
Oh yes
the back's have been
Yeah
alright
Oh yeah
There's a few of them damaged but but er m I think we've repaired most of them
You see we did get it all completely repaired when we moved in cos it was in a hell of a state from Peter
Cos Peter had this place
Yeah
That's right
Well wewewe know
We knew
about that
about that
How
Did he
Cos we
owe you money
we gone
Well
and got it actually
Did you
Bloody right
God
You must be one of the few people
It were quite good cos what we had we had th the the other partner who was you know the other partner is Michael
He was called what was he called
Ken
No no
No
No that's
Yes
that's John
But what do you call him
That er m
I know who you mean I met him yeah
Cos the other guy was a was a bar manager Duncan or
Mm
Der sum mat like that and his wife had a baby at the same time as Elaine's so she our mid wife would come and er so the she kept in touch really of of what they were because they wanted to I'll take the place off they wanted to take it over
I don't think they was er as bad a
No
shower of shit
No
as he were
No
tended to
No
be
But erin the end they never got the license back
Because what they did try and do is buy the catholic club didn't they
Top of Lancaster s
Next to the
Cos the
Alex
The Alex
They tried to get behind there the catholic
Yeah
club
Right
Then they got they didn't get it past
Mm
But er he actually owed
Yeah that used to be
about five grand at one stage and got it down to three and half and then he got to six hundred and eighty and they went to court
and then they got
He paid it
Paid it through the court
Well that was remarkably
Lucky
lucky
Yeah I know
He didn't half go for a lot again
Yes we did seem to be quite lucky to keep
Yeah
But I I I'm amazed that brewer i es keep lending him money
I know
I mean it's unbelievable you know th er he's done so many brewer i es and yet why they don't talk to wo well I mean they must talk to one another
Because you get people like Ben who's giving his money he doesn't really give a toss
He don't give a toss
Mm
As long as he's got an installation going in and if it
Yeah
if it gets written off or
Gets bigger
or someone has to take a a b i a co company has to take a big lot off
It's par for the course really
Mm
Well you know
Dreadful inn it
Well he's got that much money to burn Barry that's what it is
Mm
You've gotta burn to to cover all they've just laid three hundred and thirty management staff off management not d ray lads not brewery lads
Yeah
Three hundred and thirty managers where
I think it's your that's your T V thing is it
Yeah
T V video projection
How do you work that thing
How do you work that thing
From behind there
And where's it come there
That one
That just puts on
At the moment we use
Rock videos
Yeah
I mean Mark's got some great stuff of the sixties er er er ex ex movies of the so er trailers of ex movies you know
Yeah
sizzling sexual and all these sort of and wha what was really outrageous in the sixties looks so tame but
Yeah
it's on in black and white and fifties it looks quite good fun
Well that on a Thursday
It's
night could be a sixties night then
I mean when we get when
A fifties night even you know
when you get t ho when you get the half the er when you get sort of well like the scooter ist do s and th the DJ s bring it up I mean they bring in a hard core
You'll have to try and change the old f ash
and things
And and and quite amazing
watching Jean
Yes
picking up
Yeah
bottles on the night and bonking going on
Was Alistair ringing you yesterday
Me
Well he rang Peter
Oh God
Well he must have been trying
and they told me it was very very urgent
So I said oh
Well come and speak to him
But so I went and he said oh
Barry's dad's been on the phone he wants to you to urgently book a bus so he co
Will you see if that says that sort yeah it is
I'll put that on
I think it is isn't it
Yeah
But he does
Yeah you just bend them over
That's it
It's they're not as easy to bend as you think
Got a screwdriver round here
Do you want me to hold them up for you
And this blasted then we'll get start
You know what Colin does and what not
Right
You want me to see if I can find Mick don't you
Mick who
Mick
Actually I had a think last night I'll tell you who else you want to get hold of
Your friend who's the sign writer
Mm
Don't
Yeah
you
Harvey
Yeah
I hadn't thought of that
Lives near the factory somewhere
Might be in on Friday
Doubt it
Why
It's Saturday it was it's not bloody arrangement
Oh no
I meant I meant he lives somewhere near the factory
I think Sco use knows where he lives
Cos sometimes you see him a lot and then he has a spell of not coming in don't
Yeah
he
That's right
Mm
They keep sending they keep changing my passport
Well they do don't they
Well I'll have changed one next week
What's wrong with that brush
It's broken
It's broken
Mm
What i what's other end
Has other end already been used
Looks like looks like sawing off and redoing
Ah
it
Need to get a new brush
I think that's a point
Just get a a new stick for the
That's enough
Just go in bin
I just want to make this phone call for when we lock the door and
Mm
I'm going into Lancaster Saturday
Er m no but I can leave a message can't I
To say you know they er when Barbara must has got to go back in hospital
That little Lancaster
Mm
Er m you know she had this cancer seven years ago when she had her breast cancer and had her breast taken off they've now found it's gone further in seven years she you know she was
forgotten all about it anyway she found a little dent apparently our Laura said that's just as bad as finding lumps
She just went and said I've got this you know check up cos she knew she was going to Chris ties for her final check up and they've whizz ed her in
Got to do another operation and remove all the glands from under her arm
So it's not as though they're gonna get anyone to come
No
I mean I I obviously hadn't said that to her
Oh no
Obviously
But er she said she'd been feeling a bit rough recently
But she never suspecting it was you know when they'd been alright for seven years you
you think you're alright don't you
So she's going in today
Er m so I'm gonna go in this afternoon to see her
See if they've taken any
And I hope
I hope she does
Mm
You know
Yeah
Anything in it
Have you seen it
Yes
Well they would
Oh
A bit
You know like you being all pathetic
No
Well a bit I intend carrying on as the parliamentary candidate and somebody had obviously asked Dave why it is something has nothing whatsoever to do with the constituency
That was last time's agent
And he said oh well it's probably being discussed at the next meeting
Well he's under a lot or else he won't
Still he won't come if he thinks there's any messing about
I mean i it would be z il c h for the Labour Party to try and swap candidates now
You know it would be just stupid wouldn't it
Yeah
Mm
What would they achieve
Well that's right
I mean I don't know Dave 's just not That's stupid
Why make any comment whatsoever
Yeah
Why not just keep quiet
So you know cos it just says all candidates receiving
I mean Labour can't win either way
They've got to hope that it'll be resolved before then
If they put another candidate in it's doesn't do Labour 's name any good does it
Mm
Well it's a
It's a waste
enough of these ad pamphlets
Guilt
Well it's it's been looking as though you're you're guilty
before there's problem a admitted
I mean as we're not looking to win anyway I don't know what the hell they're bothered about
I mean it's not exactly you know the world's safest Labour seat is it
No
What was this big presentation yesterday

So I've said they can get stood on
And I booked at the Claremont which is twenty eight pounds
Well I'm not being prepared to be held to ransom by them
And I'm I'm faxing er m I'm sorry I'm not gonna fax it I'm just going to send a letter to national office about The Sa vo y in First Leisure
Because they can't do this to delegates
Cos they did it with you last year didn't they
Mm
Yeah
Yeah
Well I think we should tell national office that this is you know this is happening and it's not on
I've got I'll tell you what I've got I've got for nineteen ninety two confer e Register of Conference Accommodation from national office whe where they tell you to book
You know cos I'd got it at a P P C as well for national conference
So I've actually two you see
So er m I'm sending one back to national office saying these hotels are sending confirmation at the full price for local government conference
Now I I've rung the Claremont and they've said oh yesit's the conference er m you know amount and we're very ap par we were I was very lucky cos we got the last three rooms
And she said we're absolutely booked up
But you see Bob told me about i the said well he you know booked at the Claremont because he'd had problems getting prices out of the others
But our union always stay at the Claremont and we've always found it you know okay
But I'm I'm not paying sixty five quid a night
It's just stupid Francis
Cos you're never in it
I mean you always go to you know somewhere else don't you
I didn't ask Francis so just let me tell you er m they were when I went it's AB DE and it's got all the letters next to them
You know they say there's a full range of facilities and I'm just looking A is central bedroom I'll tell you I'll I'll I'll we'll whiz through them
A is central heating C is car parking D is street car parking E is special diet s cater ed for F tea and coffee making facility G is television in bedrooms at no extra charge I is for answering and J K I've I'm just to go all through this disabled facilities L separate M bedrooms available with private telephones in it's N number of bedrooms available with private bathroom and toilet or shower and toilet
And that's what it says
It was was when I went Francis
Night porter Q is lifts to all floor and S is swimming pool and I know there's a swimming pool because not that I ever used it but ma it it was when I booked Francis
It's right on the prom on the corner on on North Prom
It's not far from the Imperial Francis
So but it was er m just go on that bit of the prom it's huge
It's a huge hotel on the corner
You can't miss it
I'll I'll give you the o the address anyway
Er m two hundred and seventy North Prom
Yeah
Two seventy North Prom
Er m and you just say what yeah two seventy North Prom
It's it's pa just past if you keep going past the Pembroke it's there
But er m that's right going out
Yes
It's just past there
You can't lose it Francisco s it's one of the major hotels
Yeah
They've got they've got lots of bars there's a bar in the basement and there's bars upstairs and a dance floor and a swimming pool and I'm sure it will Francis
I mean yeah well I don't blame him
But it says number of bedrooms available with private bathroom and toilet or shower and toilet
There are very few hotels of this standard that don't have showers and toilets
So it's twenty eight Francis which is I think is yes
Yes
Well it doesn't matter where we go to eat does it
And we can go and eat wherever we want
Oh
But th you can have bed and breakfast and evening meal if you want
Er m but generally ye I mean cos Eileen and I go to a we nearly always go somewhere like Carriages or you know somewhere Italian which is you know it might it all depends on what Jim's eating at the time
But but you can't go wrong there's plenty to eat in Black pool can you
In fact I'm trying to think of a place that er m we once went when we at regional conference it was behind the Claremont somewhere
It was a it was a little Italian restaurant with about forty six and we went at regional conference and it was astounding
It was a really brilliant chef
I'll try and get Bob to find the the number of it
Cos that was really a really nice place
But you wouldn't have expected to find it where you found it
No
You know the road behind the promenade
It was on that road
And we only found it by chance you know how you go off to think oh I'll I'll go and find a coffee or something and we found this restaurant at lunch time and had a coffee there and we looked at the menu and you know we we couldn't believe it
Yeah
Well I'll try I'll try and get Bob to remember the name of it
Alright
And so I'll see you when we get there Francis
I said we'll a probably arrive early afternoon
So no doesn't well you know what he'll be like he'll be messing about all day
But I know Kin noc k's speaking at four isn't he
So we I want to Yeah
Yeah
Oh well he'll have to be then
Yeah
Yeah
That's alright
Don't worry
I'll I'll look after
Because there's er m there's Geoff and Louise are staying with us and Eileen and I are staying
You and Jim are staying
And I know that Bob and Sue have booked at the Claremont so there'll be quite a few of us there
So I'll I'll keep an eye on us
And I'll go and have a look at your room
Just to make sure everything's alright before he gets there
Right
Thanks Francis
See you Friday
Bye
I should have checked that shouldn't I
Well is a en suite
Yeah
I don't think it is gonna be en suite
Yeah
Well they said the number of rooms didn't it
Didn't say all rooms
And if you've got the last three I can't believe that the last three are en suite
I only need one en suite
That's what I thought
It'll be two rooms and a bath or a shower
Shall I ring back
I stayed at the Claremont when I was down doing and I can't remember where it is on the street
Well I we were when I went
John was
John but mind you John has been insistent on i the
Mm
moved a whole delegation if it weren't en suite
Yeah
Well Bob will do me a swap if it's gonna come to a crisis
I think I'll ring Mad ge up
Cos it will cause a crisis
Oh yeah
with Jim
Of course
I mean he's at the age of being in continent int he
Call me regional
Is he introducing a conference now
John unwashed and unshaved on the front de legate on the front
Yeah
Yeah
I'd er ring up just in case cos you might have to solve your problem
Better to knowing now than to know when you arrive there
Have they mended your photo copier yet
No
They won't be if you want to photocopy something
I might do
But we'll give them a ring now anyway
I need to get hold of Mayfair as well cos there's cigarettes out so
Hello it's Mrs here I've just spoken to the other lady making a booking for three twin rooms
Can you just check whether they're en suite
They are
Oh brilliant
You've saved my life
Else my chairman was er just gonna give
Oh
That's great
No problem
Thanks
Bye
P he w
Yeah
Better telephone so that she can be sure that when he asks the dreaded question that they are
Must remember I've got to talk to him about here
The answer is yes they all are
Ah
Francis I had a little panic then and I decided to ring them back
But no yeah yeah well I thought I thought I'd better be safe yeah
I don't want a weekend with Jim where I I'm in trouble all weekend
Oh don't Francis
I mean er I'dI'd never have lived it down
Yeah
Well that's what he'd say to me why didn't find out first
So anyway you're reduced from so it's en suite
Yeah
She said exactly Francis
Well we'll spend it on food and drink Francis
But er m er I feel a lot more comfortable cos I think sixty five pounds a night's outrageous
For just spending well for us when we're just you're only there for your breakfast aren't you
You never go back again
So because we'll be able to have lunch at British Home Stores
We'll not be able to break with tradition
Geoff will insist that we go to British Home Stores for well we'll if if we we're with Geoff and Louise that's where we generally go to lunch and it's really nice
It's a lovely self - s e r v i c e in Black pool
But you know the Labour Party is worse than the Conservatives for traditions aren't they
Mm
Anyway look I'll find out from Bob about this restaurant and see if there's a possibility that it might be worth booking before I go
But I know that Jim's going to have to
And I I don't want to spend all night chasing round Black pool looking for for a place that serves ordinary food of a decent standard
Right Francis
I'll leave on that note
Bye
Yeah she does want to go
They don't want him trailing down th
well we're in a next week
It would be a couple of days
I think it's
I want Mayfair as well
I want Mayfair to come
Filling the machine
Fill it up
It's empty so Mayfair fills it up
You don't know where he is do you
Oh
Right
Okay
I'll try County Hall
Right
Thanks
Bye
What's it called Mains
Mains Business Services
It's here I think but I'm not sure
Mains Mains Mains Mains
Oh
They have been getting Ma Macs first don't they
For some unknown reason
Well can I have the Labour group then please
You tell me why they has Mac before Mains
Mm
Right
L MM a in
HI J K
Close
Sor if I sorted out being able to book at this restaurant which only is about I'd be in
How many nights are you there two
Two
Be in if everybody's good books
Cos it really it's really nice
We just found it by chance
You can't can't
It
remember what it's called
I know
I just can't
Bob 'll know
Well you probably I mean you you as you as well so I mean you probably won't
No he's
be able to get there till this evening and you probably won't be able to see him will you
No
Well a as long as he knows I'm looking for him
They er m wa when we to we we were staying at the Claremont and I don't oh I think we just decided we'd find a cup of coffee
It was M S F thing we were with Margaret about the M S F.
And said oh let's go and find a cup of coffee but have a bit of a walk and walk down to conference but we'll not walk down the prom
Mm
we'll walk down the road at the back and we'd only just turned round the corner from the Claremont and we found this restaurant and it was it was an absolutely brilliant chef really nice restaurant really high quality and it was was quite reasonable price it wasn't cheap
Mm
So when we found this we thought ooh this is alright
You know we'll so we've been quite a few times since but I cannot think of the name of it
You see Jim doesn't like I mean we'd go to Carriages probably cos it's a a proper Italian
Yeah
that absolutely reeks with garlic and all the rest of it
Well that means Jim will pull a face
Or he'll start going
Oh this big international fin an c i er
Oh
No
Not I mean is the when it comes down to food wi he's a traditional ist
So we've always got to find somewhere to eat that's
You're gonna be pushed getting you know roast beef and York s hire in Brussels aren't you
God knows
Steak and kidney pie
You're joking
Cos everybody sort of just try to think think of in Brussels
Why they go they go to er a six course sort of have as much main course as you like
It's a a a re a really nice restaurant but you can pick all your food raw and they just there's a chef cooking and you just get one of these plates you can have as many helping s as you want they serve you a cold starter and a hot starter but there's a buffet that's about half the size of our club and one side of it it's all fish on a wet fish slab and steak and veal and chicken and so there's every sort of meat you can think of and you can pick a wooden platter full of it so you go and give it the chef with this number that they give you and then they come serve you with whatever you want
And you can have as many helping s of whatever you want
And the salad stuff and fresh fruit and all that sort of thing takes about the full length of our bar up you know you you couldn't think of a salad that isn't there
But you can't and there's then there's loads of hot ve g
Mm
There's no vegetables you can't mention
I think it's about twenty quid a head but you can actually have as many meals as you want or as many pudding s as you want
Yeah
It's it really is really very very good
The Labour Party came to to use that quite a lot
Because they've got big seating areas as well where they put sort of eight tables together and all your party can sit together
Mm
When we were there Stan was with us and he'd been a few times to Brussels to with the Labour Party and and he said oh it's great
Because usually you go off to a restaurant and if there's twenty of you you can't sit together can you
No
No
But he said this restaurant makes a particular thing of seating big parties
It was a brilliant restaurant
Really really nice
So you know
Serg i o's going to er m er m one some Cubs visit to London at er half term
Bad en Powell House
Yeahbut the
Mary took it
It's brilliant
Absolutely great
And er so she said she she wants to take the last couple of days away
Mm
so she's her aunt y 's going to Dublin so I got these things and they were really cheap actually
There's the train fare from here to Holy head return the ferry transfer s to their hotel the best hotel in Dublin The Bur ling ton
Mm
is absolutely stu pen do us
Two nights bed and breakfast full Irish breakfast which means you won't need to eat until the evening
You won't eat again
No
Er m train free bus passes round Dublin includes their bus fares and and train on those sort of metro type thing
Yeah
they have in Dublin all for eighty five quid
Eh
I know
Why
The only problem is that the hotel that Mary's like ah
This looks beautiful
Cos I I that second hotel hotel the only thing is the Bur ling ton
And I daren't I'm not gonna tell her but I I I'm trying to say well it's a little bit out it's in a park and er th th but it looks gorgeous
I said yeah I know
And it was where they had their honeymoon
So I'm going oh no
Not for just er Si ob han and sister - i n - l a w e r m is the head of Town and Travel and Manchester
Yeah
Town and Travel and she got the presidential suite at the Bur ling ton which is like a you know I meaner m it's absolutely gorgeous
And it was it was about two hundred pounds a night and got it for ten pounds a night
That was about well ten years agowhen well well it's really appropriate
So I think well this is a this is actually on O'Connell Street that's right in the centre
But I mean that's actually th th one one of the that was the the the other ones like four star hotels were on O'Connell Street which actually opens only seventy seven quid
I know
That's including all that travel and
Yeah
and I mean it's incredible though
Mm
And it's something like twenty quid for an extra night if you want to stay the problem is the Holy head ferrie s they're dreadful
You know
Yeah
one gets you in at seven fifteen which means you're only really getting one day
Yeah
you know for that price cos
Yeah
by the time you got in checked in got into the hotel it's gonna be nine o'clock
Yeah
You've missed the day and you've got Saturday then th ferry back is ten o'clock on the Mo or whatever day but the ferry back is at ten o'clock in the morning so you've got to leave at eight o'clock
So you really need to go the day before
I mean really you've got to book an extra night to be honest
Mm
That's what I mean you
Yeah
Yeah
there's no point in you going
No
for that I mean all you're doing is going on a ferry
I mean if the fe if the ferrie s were like early sort of bo got you in at lunch time
Mm
then that would be alright
And and that you could get say
Yeah
Cos you'd have more in the following day
get say a late afternoon one back
Cos it's and it's only about two and half
Has it got to be on the ferry has it
Yeah
Yeah
Cos it's part of the that's why it's so cheap
Part of the hotel
Yeah
We need to phone Mayfair
Oh
We need to phone Marion
I'll do it it's alright
It's been an awful long time for this part hasn't it
Mm
I mean it's been a month
Need to send away for it
Just shows the state of British industry
And the recession
It's foreign int it
Oh
That car pet's gotta be done ain't it
That carpet cleaner's coming
Don't bother about that Eileen and I will do it
Yeahbut we need a new poster though

Thanks
They er m
We need the sa spare part when I I mean we need the sort of anyway what was
Mm
happening don't we
And it's and we also need to see them mend it properly
I think we should go for
Red and blue square that you know
I can't I can't say
No
I mean we could the use the industrial
I don't know
And you could do that in the all the rest are a you could do it in the whole club to be honest
I think you should go for the blocks of colour
Mm
Cos if you got a room and you spill on it it wouldn't matter
Well I was saying that yesterday to them
I said
Right

Mm
But yo you know if you you got the tile situation you just
Mm

I think you should do the floor

Just I think we are Barry just have
I haven't
a look
Yeah
I said to him on er m su er sa Saturday night
Oh well he said to me on Saturday he said do it Thursday after
Yeah
I say so I said well I'll arrange for a delivery
But having said that he's not the most reliable person in the world
Have you given Peter your order
Yeah
Oh
And does he have to be I mean are we not gonna be there most of the time
Yeah
Co yeah we are
Well you are
I'll be back as soon as I can
Yeah
I mean I can be back for well I mean I can actually stay there in fact
Well do you want the latest
Yeah
There'sthere's Steve Dave er all the men's meeting at the hide away
Oh yeah
is now going to be at the
We think she should might stand down gracefully if she doesn't er m she we could refuse to adopt but she's over there personally
Er m I'm in two minds about what to do
I could name names and say because this is not a party decision it's
Yeah
Dave Steve et cet era and
Now who's Dave
Senior employee of the City Council
Yeah
meeting with the leader of the Labour group who's supposedly doing all this to protect his wife
The reason he's married to her I mean even
I could I could really throw the dirt at them by saying that I'll you know if there is a conspiracy there's a person here who's been involved in a very iffy part of the budget who all of a sudden after ten years of s lagging off the town clerk all of a sudden he's totally on the town clerk's side together with Councillor
Why
The only person who's involved in both allowing the town clerk to take these decisions without any interference at all
Mm
and now conspiring with a senior employee of the council and of course
Just not so
Yeah
All of a sudden this er m worry about this budget heading is being swept under the carpets and everybody being told is all in been er cleared up
It's Dave
I'd fire him
Mm
I could really make this into a very great conspiracy for
Mm
Apart from which this meeting that they're supposed to be going to have is totally out of order anyway
Cos nobody's been sent any notices for it or notified about it
So I mean I I could
What the hell are they doing now
get the full meeting can ce I mean you get Ash down yesterday his party rally round him like
Mm
royalty 's going of fashion
You get I mean Dave and Steve alright they've never been my favourite people but all this pious goings - o n with Dave how much he hates the town clerk and whatever opportunity he could get he would
Mm
take
Mm
First opportunity real opportunity he gets he's doing everything the town clerk wants him to do
Yeah
I just I I honestly Barry I've got to the stage where I believe in this conspiracy
Mm
Well certainly some people want some answers want to be given on this budget er me as well I mean he can't just suddenly say
Well
it's all been sorted out don't worry about it
Well I think it will be really stupid
But I shall say Dave
And how long
Well I park
I'll put
er
I'll drop you off
Cos I want to go home and I've got to home cos I've I've a stack of paperwork on my table
I'm not gonna be able to set off much later on remember because
There's no point in me getting
Nope
I'll have to go up to shop to get some shopping cos there's nothing to eat in the house
So I'll have to do something
Alright Barry
I just wonder what on earth they'rethey're playing at with ha cha cha cha cha cha cha
You know I just don't understand what they're playing but th you know
They
they can only be doing damage to th to the election chances I mean
Well they
they can't be achieving anything else
I mean saying things like a successor has already been identified
I mean it's just stupid
Cos the general view in More cam be isn't what they say it is
Yeahbut it gives the impression there's a split group inn it
Well you give the impression of a a faction in the party now I could I could serve this faction quite easily to Mike who'd give me a lot of say if I said you know th the the plot thicken s you know here's a town
Yeah
hall employee
Yeah
always an opponent of the town clerk also now er m trying to cause problems
Mm
I mean that really does make the plot thicken doesn't it
Yeah
I mean why was Dave being quoted for what has it got to with Dave
He's not an officer of the con stit ut he isn't a treasurer he isn't secretary he's he's nothing as far the constituency 's concerned
They if they want any quotes why don't they go and see chairman who's Terry
Yeah
I mean this is them deliberately saying things to their friends and deliberately stirring it
They oh
Because I mean I know where it's coming from some of it's coming from Stanley who who thinks if I don't stand down it will damage Ruth's chances
That's not Ruth's own view of it
Well it and I don't think with the News of the World round their necks they can afford to start playing silly people
Because I'm you know if they sa if they keep crossing me the way they are quite frankly I'm you know willing to make remarks myself
Although I don't want to do damaging things but I don't see why I should be the person con cons constantly getting the flack from a group of people who were you know
Yeah
Who are genuinely trying to do damage to the party
So do you want me to call at the 's now
Yeah
There's may as well
Well don't know
Well it doesn't really matter I'll I'll be I mean what so I mean there's except for seeing Anne there's nothing more to do is there
Well except to start getting that rubbish cleared away
Well I can't put it away
Don't want a pile in the cellar when carpet delivery comes
No but I p u put it next to the lift and as soon as Hug hey comes put it outside and when I come back I'll take it away
No you won't cos I'm meeting El li al at at half three
Well I mean I should be back for half past two
I mean if you want to just put it in that dust bin place and we'll take it tomorrow
Mm
You know the washing up machine and everything all all of that needs cleaning out all behind the bar needs cleaning
We're giving people a very bad impression if we're opening tonight and nothing's been cleared up
I think I'll go for it Barry
I'll I'll go and see where he is and say you know That washing up and everything wants doing before tonight so you so if you're gonna say oh we're open tonight and the place still looks like a pig s t ye
It ain't gonna give a very good impression
Well he's not gonna want to he's not sha I mean he's it's not a meeting to look around the place is it really
Well it is
That's what they're coming for
That's one of the things Richard is coming for to look round
We'll come and have a good look round I've never seen it
I meaner you know what that's to do with don't you
The repairs notice
Even if we only got all those old tickets and things into green bags and started cleaning that out it would it would look as though we're making some effort
Er if I can get the and get him to come in reasonably soon you know I'll ring you and tell you whether he's in
If we could get him to come in reasonably quickly you could get all that stuff down and bagged up and we could get rid of it couldn't we
Which which tickets are you talking about
Well all the old tickets and stuff I mean alright
Where
From where
In the bottom office
Oh yeah
As well as all the junk that's in the cleaner's room it all wants getting rid of
I mean what's happening about these speakers then
I mean is this supposed to be happening tonight or
No
what's
Well it's it's a trial
Go in then
Just stop if there's any mail
No there's nothing
Oh
Okay
I'll go and get in and get on with
Alright

What do you want

I'm gonna have Budweiser J D you know go
Mm
American stuff
through the yeah I'm gonna
M hm
the thing is you see if we do it an American flavour I mean people expect heavy rock music in an
Mm
American bar don't they
Mm
I mean you expect to be going in and listening to Bon Jo vi and and Free and you know in the background don't you
You have
Yeah
Well I mean
Put in ju k e boxes
Yeah
I mean you could be up with the fucking couldn't you
For
Well that's well well wellwe're thinking of opening
Just as a pub like
yeah we're gonna open as a pub during the summer er m
What about all these Barry
No we'll keep those for su you never know
Yeah okay
Put them in here
So we have and er m we're gonna open up the top bar top bar and ripping up the carpet
in the main room and li no in the main floor right in in sort of
Which one
probably blue
The one
Yeah
And redoing the stage floor
And I'm carpeting I think I'll carpet tile
Have you had a price on what it's gonna cost to put that down
Not that much cos we're getting the li no off Pete you see and get the discount off to do the just for the li no
Oh right
Yeah course
and then make it
Rh on a's husband
Yeah
Ex - h u s b a n d y e a h
Er m and having a carpet tile because we can then do it red white and not white but red and blue you know
Yeah
And if you
Yeah
damage a tile then you're only replacing a tile
And just sort of carpet the two top areas two raised areas and have the other the rest of it as a sort of li no floor
Mm
So thenthen it allows to dance as well and basically hardly anybody sits in that are a until the club's full anyway
Mm mm
so that they all go in the
Er m going to somehow at the moment we're thinking of well Jean 'll wanna do it but I'm I'm thinking of doing some kind of I mean we're agreed on what we're gonna do but it's how we do it I want some ka er some kind of grilling around the top the cocktail bar are a so you can open it as a as a bar and it'll have a sort of atmosphere in itself so we open that as a pub type of thing you know
Oh right
Yeahyeahyeah
Leave the big screen on and that and we can put er m and get you know as I say if you
Do you
you get see if we can get hold of like I mean you won't be able to get hold of a Wu r lit ze r because nowadays they're like gold dust but you might be able to get hold of parts you see
If you could just get hold of say the rainbow
Yeah
effect of a Wu r li I mean that's the beauty about it you you'll never get hold of a Harley Davidson but you might get hold of a petrol cap
Yeah
You know or things
Yeah
like that you know
Yeah
and you just bang those around the place
Era few handlebars and whatever else and but but but don't do it like the British bikers do it like an American bar so it can be cleaned and
I mean it can look nice and
Yeah
sparkling and fifties e y and lots of pictures and
Not the dirty bloody smell and greasy
No that's right yeah
That's right
You see and then ififif if if sort of people are you know holiday makers come in and it's an American the me they expect it
Mm
As I say they expect I've got music it's not gonna come as a shock to them
They've got
You know and it'll and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I think
And and it won't cost a lot to do cos all you do instead of green you'll paint that red and you've got the white pick out anyway and a blue seated blue carpet
I wondered what those fucking
Nowhere am I gonna be able to get rid of this
I don't know
I think we'll have to I think we've got to keep it cos I think it's part of the fix tu res and fittings unfortunately
And I'm gonna do er you know lots of promotions and stuff promotions on that
And then your promotions yeah
Yeah
Yeah
We well what I think I'm gonna do is next T hur not this Thursday we'll just have to live through this Thursday but next Thursday er m I'm gonna get get Stella back on and I'm just gonna sell it as cost whatever it is sixty P a pint or whatever

Yeah
I mean cos at the end of the day if you've got the if you've got if you can get er sixty people
You'll
two fifty to come in I don't mind if I'm giving the booze away
And er as long you got the
As long as you're not losing on it
Yeah
Well it doesn't matter does it
You know cos that's the only way we're gonna build Thursdays up
No
That'll be gone then
Je Jean's is it
Right
Get rid of it
Oh no maybe not
Jean's doing tonight
I thought it had gone off
Jean's doing tonight and I'm doing Friday and Saturday
So er
She's away int she
She's away
Yeah
Er but you know I I'd as I say I think er and then if we just if we can just pick up like the odd I mean I've I've had a long chat with Anne we've had a longer m meeting with Anne yesterday about it and she's gonna start pushing cos you know she's really done the Royal upstairs it's
Mm
a really beautiful room but it only holds about forty fifty people what she's gonna do is push the weddings but she's gonna and say look you can use this place
For the reception
For any any anything bigger you know you've got
Well for dancing
Yes
Yes
you've got forty people you want somewhere bigger then fine
Cos er Mark last week said er he'd been approached by a wedding to do a disco he said well I can't it's a Saturday and then he said well you know where are you having the reception said well we're looking round at the moment
Mm
Well can't he said look have a word and he said to me you know do you mind if we do like eight till eleven o'clock as a wedding party
Right yeah
Well
and then we just do the disco afterwards
Anyone can stay on if they want can't they
That's right
So we just get them in we open up our doors at ten o'clock
And I mean I wanna change the ten o'clock opening it's bloody silly is that
That's just bloody ridiculous that
I mean we may as well come in at twenty to ten and and have twenty minutes of you know because nine thirty you know
The only people you get in before nine thirty don't drink anyway do they
No
Just
Well we don't need to come in
They did last when did they come in last week
Is it Thursday they came in
Thursday
Yeah they came in really early about four of them didn't they
Oh
We thought they were yeah and they fucking bought one drink between them
Yeah
That's right yeah
That's right
Right
Well you won't want these
Er no I'll leave them
Leave that but er
Well
What
M hm
Right I'll leave this
Should be alright there shouldn't it
Yeah well you'll have to leave it anyway
It's the wrong size actually
Will I just dump this whole lot
Yeah

Yeah
Then and then you can shall I get a oh that's the other thing I'm gonna get the toilets redone
I'm getting the toilets
I don't know if we can dump this here
What are they
Oh those
One of them things for the plant or for the
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh
What I'm gonna do is get the toilets I'm gonna get the toilets the gents toilets all the urinals ripped out and getting it troughed all the way around
Yeah
that L though and that's why
But before I got I er I suggested that fucking years ago
I know
We well we did we looked at it when we first opened but it was like another grand to do that
Is it
Yeah
Is that what it's gonna cost
Nine hundred quid to just just for the trough ing
Well so you gotta be fucking right you you must be paying nine hundred pound out
No
every fucking three months
That's right
and all
That's right
Well you pa yeah you certainly pay nine hundred pound a year out anyway damage to the toilet seat and so you know that'll pay itself back in a year and you know
And also it's just the hassle
Yeah
And there's er I mean it was showing somebody round the other day and we were talking about it and and er m they're saying yeah I mean you've got seven urinals there so let's say you have a busy night you're full I mean that's when damage gets done when people
M hm
are sat around waiting
Mm
Mm
you know and they're and sat on sinks and whatever else so you know you could you could get twenty guys on that urinal that you can get for seven
Er m well I'm obviously going on yeah let's just I was saying just dump it all
And er ah these
Right I've just gotta phone Alan upstairs so
Okay
a couple of things
He's looking at doing a me he's doing a menu of stuff for us so er will that go in that'll go in the lift won't it

Yeah
That's right
Well er there's er m
There's some brilliant short breaks now

London Hilton

Sorry it's one night
Well if you're gonna pay a hundred and fifty a night
Oh yeah
up in them
That's right
Oh yeah
I mean but your train fare alone will cost you it'll cost you thirty quid
Course
Yeah
Yeah
You know when we we when we first opened from a dead start right
The first fifty five weeks which is
Just over a year
a year we did na on the bar did ninety thousand quid
Jesus
The next five months less than half a year af the next five months after that right
When Jean stopped doing her silly things
Yeah
Well yeah when whe er er a after that first year the next five months seventy nine thousand
Fucking hell
In five months
So if we'd have carried on at that
So you would have like you would have well doubled that
Yeah
I mean tha th we it have been
Five months you would have equal led
Well I think we'd have gone to two hundred thousand
Yeah
But that at the end of that period was when Vol ks recalled the loan
Aye
And
And
you were buying seventy off them or something
Yeah
But er but when
You were getting all your orders from them at that time
Yeah
But when Vol ks recalled the loan we sort of give up
Yeah
I we went two day week opening and not public iz ing it everything
Yeah
So if we'd have just carried on the way that was going I mean that got it from ninety thousand in just over a year to to seventy nine thousand in five months
Jesus
It's amazing
Know what I mean like we didn't want
Surely they've saw the trend
Well
You did show them
I think
No Barry don't I don't you're not fucking doing nothing
Cost you a fortune that stuff
Yeah
Right
That one
Looks like a motorbike handlebars you can stick it on the wall
What about this milk milk machine
No bung it
Whoops
Over there
Look at all that shit there
What on earth's that
That's one of the sh amp er carpet shampoo s
It's probably when Jean bought it
Right

Yeah
They can go as well
We've got enough mop heads brush heads rather we just haven't got any not connected to the brushes
Will that go in the bin
We might as well carry it down

And we've never found where they're fitted
Will we keep this
Er may as well
Mind you I don't know we got oh yeah keep it I suppose

Yeah
Could just leave tha lay those bowls over there

The sweets
Oh yeah

Yeah good idea
Probably get less chance of getting broken out there
What's happened
Yeah
That over there
Have we got any screwdrivers around
I dunno
Probably
I think there's one on the
Not much good
I suppose we could put that door back on again inside
Yeah
Oh wait
I'm gonna fix that no do I'll yeah I'll bring some from home cos I wan I wanna nip home for er an hour and I'll er I've just seen Anne
What are you doing with these for
Er m American stuff for
Mm
Yeah
I'm gonna do like chill i es and whatever you know
She she can re do them and we just have microwave them when as and when
Ah
I need somebody in to do that
The bar staff could do that like
Ye oh yeah
Could they
I think
Yeah
just get them all you can get them for them
Yeah
Have them fucking ready made up and just
Cos
move them out
Cos even
Simple
even r i I mean rice does really well in a microwave
Well you can have them in the freezer
You can freeze rice and then put it straight in the microwave
Yeah
Just just to sprinkle on water on them
Just seal them up with a fuck it's called
That cling film stuff
Yeah
Right
I've just snapped the screwdriver
I bet you it's an ordinary screwdriver
No
No it's a my word
Don't touch them things grease on it
Shit
Why is it cleaner's rooms always end up like this
Dirtiest room in the whole
Yeah
See this was this was the dance floor before
Yeah
er where it follows this line
Yeah
And it was a sort of funny shaped thing
Yeah
Just to here
And it was like nothing so we just extended all this out and made it into a stage come a bigger dance floor cos the I don't know why they wa always seem to have this trend s that they have these trend s in the seventies and that was and eighties of having small dance floors
Right tiny dance floors yeah
Right that's and the disco console was open to the public so the public could just wander in and tap the D J on the back and tu change his records for him or whatever
It's a stupid opera so we've fenced that in
Er m but this is the are a up here Anne that I was sort of thinking that we could if we can some kind of trellis or something around this raised are a here you could actually open this bit as the as a pub on a
With what
Sorry
as a sort of pub you know on a Saturday and Sunday in the season
Food and that
You know and with a big screen you can have like sport or Grandstand or
Right
ro music videos or whatever you wanna do
Get satellite in and get M T V on
Mind you the satellite 's gonna cost three hundred quid
Roughly
This is like cocktail bar bit
Yeah
isn't it
Yeah
I mean change all the paint o pa paint all the change all the green to sort of red
Green shouldn't be up anyway
Yeah
Red and then you got the white pick out
Yeah
and you got the blue seats so you've got red white and blue haven't you
Yeah
They aren't cheap chairs these either
Yeah
are they
Oh no
Nothing was cheap I mean
No I wouldn't have thought it was
the seats are good you know these tables are bloody heavy
And they've done a you know they did a good job when they built it
Er m I mean you can see what he what he intended doing was the plans were beautiful
This was gonna be there's a piano there on that
Mm
raised are a there so this was like a piano bar
Yeah
there was gonna be a big fountain in the middle there
Yeah
this wasn't gonna be disco
No
a big fountain in the middle there
Yeah
and an orange grow
Yeah
type affect it was gonna be called the or a this was the blue one so that was the orange
Yeah
purple whatever
The bar was a double - s i d e d open
Bar across that other side
Yeah
Great
And the other side
Yeah
which was gonna be a big glass ed disco
Yeah
in there and that was gonna be the disco and this was the you know I mean it was a good idea I don't know why he pulled out with went half - c o c k
Er m you know
True
These are the things we were talking about yesterday these up rights
I mean they just
Er m
open for
well you could shorten them anyway
Yeah
You could just shorten them And
I mean they're very sort of v and al easy or whatever
V and al a fa er v and al friendly hoo li g an friendly aren't they
Yeah
Whatever
You know I mean we just got them cheap er m lamp shades from now on er cos it's not worth it cos th the expensive ones are just getting damaged all the time
We could shorten them anyway and just put lamps on them
Yeah
Whatever
If you don't hang them on Gerry 's thingy anyway
No you don't
That's right
See if you sort of somehow trellis that are a that side in you could actually have this mo more intimate if people just wanted to
S no g
sit in here
Yeah
Yeah
If you got you know if you got a character behind the bar could er attract people by his own force of personality
I think er m you could but you know really then you think when
Mm
they come in we can start
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah it is
Cos I wouldn't lo I mean I actually don't think you can do if you're gonna do people are gonna eat I th I think you're gonna be pushed at more than about hundred and fifty to two hundred
You know depends on how you retail it first but
I think it depends which it what you
Yeah
do
Yeah
Er m
I mean it depends a as you sayer yeah I mean it does depend that
Cos if if you if you if you wanted to you could always utilize all the dance floor are a tables and things you know
If you had that kind of function that you you know
Mm
Makes it difficult to do a big functions though in here with that stage
Oh yeah
You know to set out
Yeah
you co there's no way
Yeah it does
you can set out for two hundred
No
No
What we did do
And so
very well
Yeah
er m we were we some of the jazz stuff I mean
Yeah
it it it never worked in a sense that it wasn't commercially viable
No
but things like Kenny Ball and that we'd had
Yeah
and we had like the ta tres tle tables in all these al cove s and people came and actually booked a meal
Yeah
and and you had a meal and sat and watched the band and everything
It w or i I mean for those it did work
Different sort of like
it did work
Yeah
Just
But
need the
you can see everywhere
And it did
Put hot food
Yeah
up at the back as well there
Mm
Have you actually ever seen round this place properly
Not properly
No I haven't really
Whe whe where do you get to that round round
No
part
No you can't that's one of the do you wanna sta I'll just go and get the key so you can have a
Yeahgo on
quick look in there
I'll go up there
Get your bearings
Yeah
It actually looks bigger looking that way than it does when you're up there looking back I think
Er m I'm thinking of atmosphere
But if we if we carpet the two raised areas in a sort of attract hard wearing li no e y type affect on there cos you can
What about the slipping
you can dance
Well you get
The carpet don't it really up here
No
Well i it's been down since it opened so that's
Oh
gotta be eight or nine years
Mm
It's done well then
It's done well
It was on
Yeah
concrete
Yeah
like
Oh right
So this is just this is just virtually there you can't get through that way anywhere
No you can't no
Oh
Right
Like so it's sort of self - c o n t a i n e d in one
Yeah
sense
Er
Right
So it'll have to be that one in there
And
Oh
So right
Right
When Trish had a do in here her fortieth she let
A what
er Trish had her fortieth birthday here
She laid there's a tremendous amount of wasted space here really
There is
Er m
Ah
This stage across
Yeah
She laid out in here and people just wandered in off the back end here
Yeah
But I mean we've always wanted to utilize this but we can't really we built that wall here and it's just a this is the back of the disco
I mean al it's all none of it's sort of
Determined wall
determined walls I mean it's no no wall there at all
I mean we put this up just
Yeah
to break that
Yeah
because this is the console bar
Is that Cola
It's for it's for the cellar yeah
This is nice and big inn it
Well it's not I mean
Should think they've had quite a few
Not bad
Oh yeah
Mm
Obviously you've got a better eye tha than I have but er
You wa er what you want in here is one tha is tha is what's e what's extraction like
Is it good
Fine
You want a chair for over here for doing
Yeah
American stuff
Yeah you do yeah
Do kebab s and everything
Yeah
We've got er m somewhere a pizza oven
Oh
You have you got a
Yeah
pizza oven
Yeah
Yeah
Right
So that's alright
I've enough afternoons
Well you won't need to do that now
It's somewhere anyway we've got
Jesus wept
pizza oven
What is it
Ice making machine
What's that a dishwasher
Glass was her yeah
Glass was her I meant
We've got er
Have you got one behind bar
No
There's not
There int one behind the bar
No
Oh out in garden
Oh right
I see
So basically they've gotta just tray it up
What you want is
tray it up here and then
yeah here and then
bang it straight in
Er m
Why's your bar so high
I can't reach your pump
Yeah
Have you
We like to keep the floor nice and sticky so the staff can't run away
Oh I see
Once they're behind here they're stuck all night
Think you got some cleaning you just want that back in
Mm
You know what I mean it's got
And all that up there
Mm
Now then so you'd carpet them two
Yeah
and then sum mat washed
Well you see hardly anybody ever sa they don't really sit in this are a all they do is er I mean they only sit
Around the bar
right at the end of the you know
Yeah
when it's full they'll sit on those two tables
You were going to clear that are a anyway don't they
Yeah
I mean everybody round here just stands or sits on those bar stool s
Mm
Yeah
When people first come in they go for the raised areas and sit down
O
You have to see
or they stand at the bar
It's and and if you actually look on the actual are a we're talking about there's only one two threefour there's only about half a dozen tables
Yeah
Which is you know at maximum you're gonna get twenty four people sat around there anyway
So I think in a way it's er m a bit wasted carpeting it all
Cos it's a big are a
I do
to carpet
One twothree
I mean the quotes we had ranged from sort of
Well you wo did you look to change the carpet
eighteen to twenty seven
because of the name on it
Well yeah and
You are
and it's getting past it to be honest
I mean these metal strips are down there for the public entertainment license they weren't gonna give us it because the carpet was lifting
Yeah
So I mean not weren't gonna give us it but we had to do it for
Yeah
you know at the time
Yeah
And you can see like like there can you see straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet but there's er been a li a bit of a leak at some stage
Oh right I see
There's one there
I mean
Yeah
if you've got it carpet ed once you got that you you're you're stuck aren't you
You know
Yeah
you've either got I mean we've either gotta put a table on top of it or
Yeahthat's it or sit on there or get
Yeah
somebody to stand with it
you know
Yes
Er m or replace the whole damn carpet
I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune
Bloody hell
It must it must have been absolute arm and a leg
Mm
Absolute arm and a leg
Er
But it it's not a bad size room in the sense that
No it int no it's it is
in the sense that you can get three hundred in
Mm
well we often get four hundred in if you're you know I mean just have the right
Mm
party er m
How many you licensed for
Three hundred
Three
But you can get but a hundred people can have a decent atmosphere as well
Mm
You know it
Well that that's good you see
Yeah
cos I mean some places that are fairly big th the if you've got hundred in they just it looks empty don't it
No that's right
That's right
I mean
Er m
that's the Carlton's problem inn it
You know if it unless it gets
Ooh
God
Yeah
unless he's got five hundred in yo yo you feel as if you're in a barn aircraft hanger
Well that's right
Mm
But the sort of chrom e a and all that sort of lends itself to one of them aircraft things doesn't
Yeah
it
Yeah
It does
It does yeah
So you wouldn't have to spend a fortune on on on I mean it's only a matter of most of it's a matter of paint and then hanging a few things up isn't it
Change the atmosphere
Well er yeah well it is but I think cos one you've got to look at oh a bit of a design as well a while you're at it you might as well just get one or two bits
Oh yeah
Yeah
you know
Yeah yeah
True
Er m oh yeah
One two it's alright I'm trying to think
if you're gonna make all this into a dance floor and all the rest of it what's the be a er er er benefit of having a stage
If all this is virtually gonna be it's virtually gonna be dance floor int it really
Mm
Well there is no benefit
Cos if you didn't have that it'd make this room more viable in as much as er m the point of view of doing doing catering and functions and all the rest of it
You can't you couldn't say right we'll do a function for hundred and fifty and two hundred and really to do you've got to be looking to do a a sit down function for two hundred
Right
if you because it's more than the Headway can do
Yeah
comfortably
And it's more than er and you can certainly do a better job than the Carlton so I mean you don't call I mean you don't call him any competition at all I don't but you've got to look at being able to do functions for two hundred
Mm
Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it
Well it is but having yeah but with their
Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms
I'm talking about the Carlton
Right
Not Che l s tons
Not Che l s tons right
The Carlton up
Right
here
Yeah
It really and truthfully like the Headway do plenty of functions and the rest of it but you can do a better job than Headway
Mm
No two ways about wi it in a min in a
But if you can do if if you can do a two hundred thing for sit down you're gonna be in among the functions
Mm
Definitely
Plus the fact like you sa er like I say if you're gonna have a dance floor in here there int any benefit about having the raised are a is there
No that's very true
And er and it it it makes a lot of difference actually
I would have thought so
Mm
I mean cos the bands can still set up can't they
Oh yeah
If they sit up here
Well you can do what yeah
Yeah
But they still sit up there and they can still see them
Mm
And it's makes it a it makes it a different space totally different
Mm
And like I say if you're gonna carpet it er not carpet it you're gonna cover it you might as well cover it totally
Oh yeah
Well
I wonder what you'd use though
You ca you're gonna you're gonna cover it I mean we've got to re
You've gotta cover that anyway
we've got to re - c o v e r that
That's what
stage anyway
So you're not so all you're
So
doing is taking that out but
Yeah
surely in a lot of ways it might makes all the difference Barry
Mm
Makes it and it makes in a way so that it it's not a
Well you can create a dance floor are a with tables and chairs
Yeah course you can
All you do is just put them round there
Just put them round
I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House
Well that's terrific
they've got er actual flat floors
Get rid of all that and you have got more table are a because i they can sort of sit in th in the the
Yeah
gang way
Yeah
you know so I think I think that would it's alright I just keep freezing up
Do you wanna sit in there rather than
No my I'm better stood here
Oh
No I'm better stood here
But I've got to I do this you know I just sit and look
Mm
Oh no I don't stand a lot
Well that's but I've I've got to er so I think definitely that wants to come out
Er m and er
Because I mean if you ever got anything you really need a little you could always bring a little stage in
Well Yeah
Staging 's no problem is
No
it
No
You know
I mean
now we need er m alright we're gonna we'll keep these mirrors and everything
Them mirror til es and everything
I should think so
They cost us a fortune
Cos I mean them marked
I nearly ca what they call it
Aren't they
Mm
Called the
Er it's just that re - s e a t i n g that just on that middle one actually that's bad int it
Mm
Well I've yo you need to redo the the fixed seating
I mean some of it o you'll get away with but generally you re you need to recover it it's going all over the place and it
What if you could get something with stars and stripes on
Mm
Yesbut it's dirt on it
The trouble with the American red it's a it's it's not a maroon it's a
No it's
bright pillar box type
Mm
red inn it
Yes
You know it's
Oh my God
You don't want to
So if anybody if anybody spills anything on it or whatever
Mm
it's gonna show like a
Yeah
Well that's one's left cos that one well it's better than green when it's down isn't it
Mm
But I th i
I know that sort of creates that atmosphere there but I think er m sorry
Go on
Get them lamps down I think
Cos I mean yo you can easily chop them off and put sum mat else smaller on can't you with lamps on
Mm
If you want to create that sort of an atmosphere
Are we there int a door is there from kitchen to there
Well it's
There's just a hatch which is alright
Yeah
because then well that'll just do service from there but the only trouble about that is that
Anyway not to worry
Alright
Round again then
Nay problem
I mean if you've got a function you haven't got that much of bar trade
No but
in the sense that
No
being busy have you
No
You know
No
No
And is er m yeah I think that'd make all the difference if that comes out
You can soon redo the D J 's little er
Oh yeah
No I think you'd leave the D J 's
Oh yeahbut I mean you can soon sort of make it so that it's er
Oh yeah well Jean keeps buying
it's extended
Jean keeps Jean keeps buying these this atrocious cheap wallpaper and sticking it everywhere
Oh my God
Look at that
Well yeah it looks er m you can put same thing up but properly
Oh yeah
Yeah
Er m that's that
Well on that you could do something stars and stripes e y all round there couldn't you
Yeah you could
Yeah
Yeah
No problem
Sort of have it all over Who is it's gonna come and see me on Monday
Er Webster s
Wilsons
Wood bind er
Yeah
Yeah
Er m throwing money about a bit
You don't wanna throw about
Anyway itititit it's just they're gonna gonna come and see me gonna bring me a list of what they have
The
Right
and all that
Oh right
Yeah
Er m they do er m I'll tell you what they do
They've got they do Wood bind er obviously
Yeah
They put the new new
Wood bind er long neck
or sum mat in bottles
Mm
Wish I could find my glasses she said
Right
Ca er er Miller Lite K or or sum mat
Yeah
K ron en burg wha Sixteen Sixty Four
Mm
Carl s ber g and Carl s b o is it export that
Yeah
strong stuff
H off meister Ho l s ten and Ho l s ten Ex porter Michel ob tha but he's gonna bring me a
Mm
Tiger
Right
beer or sum mat
Oh yes I've heard of that
Yeah
They do they
Well Co Miller and Bud are all American beer
Yeah
Well that's what he said
Er m but they John Smith range as well you see
Yeah
Cos that's Miller Lite int it
Er m so he's coming on he's coming for his he's bringing the on Monday
Nice lad him
Yeah
Really nice lad
So er m I went to where is it you said
Couldn't find one American cook er y book
Well that int true I could find one and it were twenty seven pounds fifty so I left it was full of pretty pictures
Isn't that a lot
Yeah
But I found some barbecue recipes and all that that'd be good
Yeah I mean the other thing on on American of course is you can do all that Ca jun stuff can't you
Yeahthat's that's yes that's what I wanna
And New Orleans are a you know
that's what I thought because I've got er m I've got a somewhere I've got four hundred and some cook er y book
Oh
I've never been interested in American stuff
Well Ca jun stuff and all that I thought and then there's them you can do some long kebab s and all that that's why if we get one of them charcoal grill s that you can pa shoo she e shoo
You know not er all easy
And and if you're gonna do burgers we'll do proper burgers you know not
But you can do like you can do vegetarian burgers and all sorts
So er m is that paper up there
Yeah
Look er m could do with being having a doorway across back of here couldn't they
Oh
I don't know though bu er opening and shutting doors don't appeal to me when you
No
No
True
Looks nice but
Yeah I mean this looks almost like a school but I mean
Well no well I th i but I think some some you're better with two shelves really
In in a way for for quick quick
Well nowadays nowadays everybody wants two drinks anyway don't
Yeah
they
I mean it's not like
No but but
it used to be a
Yeah
everybody wanted warm
When you think about if you just serving two or three hundred to keep opening and shutting bloody cupboard doors er m fridge doors it's no good
Chill 's best I think anyway
Mm
So er m so yeah right I've got oh
Yeah I th i yeah I think you're right actually
You need to get rid of that and it's and create a dance floor
Yeah create
what and what I'd do is I'd put a few more spots in
Yes
no those spots around
Yeah
there shining on the
Yeah
floor put some round the back so
Yeah
you actually just use
Yeah
see but I er I think creative use of spot lights is better than than specialized lighting effects which A cost a fortune but B
And you get out of
as soon as you've seen them they're out of date
Well that's it
That's right
Cos they're only effective one time that's the first time you see them
yeah
After that it's
And we don't want to fork I mean
No
No
So er m I mean you can just use colour ed spots it in I mean those at the moment are just literally stage spots all they are i are on and on dim
Oh right
Yeah
then you can dim them up or whatever
Yeah I have them
but they can't flash
No
so what we need is a small unit in there and and I mean it's only two or three hundred quid er and a few er m
Most places where er m you know they've got them in that where you go to
Yeah
you can pick stuff up for next to nowt
Just have it ready - made say you want it for
Yeah
Well marvellous
But I think er er yeah I think that's definite take that out it really it really would make the difference to er m
Yeah it would actually thinking about it
Would it'd make it it'd make it well it'd just transform it I mean just no two ways about it I think
You've got that er m what time's that chap coming half past three
Yeah
Well I think er is this alright if I look in here or
Yeah course
I'll just get my er m
Yeah I mean i it's keep on walking round till you get familiar with it
Yeah well that I mean I just yeah cos I need
In
to
in there is staff toilets and your spirit store
Oh
Yeah where's thingy
Food store in here
Where where
And it's locked
yeahbut where's er m
Cellar
Yeah
Down below the bottom
Yeah
Right down and how do you have to go outside to get to it
That's a bit silly
It's a pain in the neck
But it's er
Well that's how it is at the minute inn it
So
But now Vol ks actually looked at er m build i putting a lift in and building a lift to it
Oh
You can't be doing with that
I mean but okay well all it means is you get twen yo once you start getting busy you get twenty two s not eleven s
I mean
And thirty sixes eventually
And thirty sixes that's right
Yeah
But er we've got three stand up freezers and the
Yeah you could have loads there'sthere's loads of room if you could ge if you if you bring that do it in here
In the chest freezer
freezer
Chest those are those are freezers
That's
Good spaces
that's a chest freezer
Yeah well
So you got three standing one chest and a fridge
Oh there's loads of room in there
Yeah
And then it's er
That's the lift down into the cellar
I'm not riding down in that
So she could send you can send stuff down in that can you
Yeah it takes er m you can get half a dozen crates in you could get eleven gallon if you wanted
Oh aye
Cos you'll have to keep your beer down there won't you
Yeah
Are there any way I can oh mind you you've to get it up anyway haven't you
Yes
You see look lots of people'll write on there won't they
Yeah
Oh yeah
That's right
Better just you just in sa well I don't mean better but it just makes just the difference now so what can I say
National S cutters
That's er from a rally
Oh yeah
Oh right
Association of Rallies
Right
I don't think that looks different like that
So that's so big
See the but er this room drives me up the wall
I mean I
Go on tell me again
Is that back of stage
This is back of the stage
And back of disco
Yeah back o back a no it's the D J
This is the back this is the D J is here
Oh right
Yes
This is just a back wall that is
So really if we got shot of all that cos really you want to make another hatch
Give it a bit more room
Yeah
Yeah
Which then would make
Yeah
Oh my God
Done it again
I thought I'm hearing yeah you could make a ra er you can make another hatch
Yeah could but
It should er m
Or you can do all these round here
Yeah
And you could have this for your preparation are a if you want
Yeah
Cos when er side int it
It's just happened to er you're gonna have to get some what they call it
The things showing round there them
You don't want it
I don't smoke
Oh well they're not I mean they're not put out for
Yeah it's a big
Oh
Oh
Have to be really aren't they
Mm
Right there's a so I mean say
I mean at the moment all the food is is protecting the license cos you've got to do food food up to two o'clock
You've got to have food available
Oh yeah definitely
Yeah
So I mean we're just going through the motions at the moment I mean quite hone
But you have food
Yeah
But I mean quite honestly we haven't
No that's a that's right but I mean that's neither here nor there is it
No
But you see you've got the potential to do a big opera a bigger operation
Mm
You see and er
Well that's where I mean you can make money on the food sometimes can't you
And that's that's where you've got
Make the money yeah
And this is why takes to get all this down and get get a location better than the Carlton for the I mean alright we aren't gonna be able to do the three or four hundred but then we
No no
I can't imagine anything worse than doing a function for three or four because by the by the laws of average how the hell are you gonna get it out to them all as it should be
I mean de a I I think he doesn't do a bad job on to be fair
No he doesn't
I mean he does the big functions and he doesn't do a bad job
No he doesn't
he's better than he was a few years ago and
Ah yeah
and and
Oh yeah definitely
he's
yeah
A he's I think Rob gets a bit ups a bit wound up because there's no
I tell you what amazes me Mary he take she can take a conference when they have a big do he puts them there for the you know for their dinner or whatever they
Yeah
got there
And he's she s keeps on at him all the time he's never taken a photograph of the place laid out for a big dinner
So she keeps sort of saying well of course er you're taking an organizer round the disco aren't you
You're like you know he's stood in the disco and you go to him
Yeah
well it's all laid
Yeah
out
Well they'd like I'd like to know
They've gotta imagine it you ought to have like a pull
Yeah
a photograph and say o o mph
Say that we want it set up in here with a photograph and that wants to be on the thing out si
Yeah
in the cape outside
Yeah
Yeah
Er m but to do but like I say if you've got somewhere that could just er er you see cos I mean what the most we can do is fifty
Mm
down there
That's right
Then er which is nice i it forty 's lovely
Forty 's absolutely lovely to do
And that and that's it but I mean to do to have somewhere to do two hundred like this would be absolutely incredible
Could always do small weddings down there and and then the big do
Mm
at night up here
That'd make that just totally makes it different
I want to just go and have a look in them you see if you've well anyway Well er mI might get to a certain extent
Cos you're nearly
Yeah
aren't you
Mm
Again this is look it's the same as this
Shit
Well where's that go
That's the fire escape down to outside
Oh so you couldn't you'd have to leave them
No you can't no you can't no
But that's that are a we were looking at
Either side of the disco console
That's the passageway we just walked down
And that's the are a you were banging
Oh that's where I were banging on wall
Yeah
Right
Yeah
Well that'd be fine because then it means that you've got either you've got your back in
Mm
and out or whichever way
Yeah
round you
Yeah
want to do it
So that fine all this comes down
And you can still sort of ma make it elevated up this really nice and
Mm
whatever
That's that wallpaper int it
Yeah
Right so this is
It's actually you know if you took the time you make a tremendous it'd make a tremendous big are a wouldn't it
Brilliant
No messing
Right depends what the and quite honestly if you bring these down and make them a bit more romantic
Yeah
you know
God knows what they'll get up to
Well I a don't give a bugger me
I aren't bothered for them
Fifteen there's fifteen there and whatever they need here
Thirty seven
See you could seat fifty on here
Yeah
I I think I ca I once upon a time I did on the fixed seating for for I think you could get about a hundred and twenty round
Yeah
there
O as it is
Yeah
As it is
Yeah
Packed out
Er
But you see the other thing the other thing that er that's worth when you've had the smaller do s you know
Mm
sort of even even like sixty eighty people you can lay one of these raised areas out as the big cold buffet are a
Oh the buffet yeah
Yeah
which kills a lot
Yeah
of space in the club
Yeah
The only thing that worries me about taking that out is that you then create a massive empty space if you have got
No you don't
sixty seventy people you have to then
No you don't because what you do is you do it down there
Well
And this is off
Yeah
inn it
Yeah
Then you go back and sit up there
That's it
Yeah
Yeah
You do it down there and this is er m if you did it over there it would look absolutely dreadful
You do it down there you set it up in the middle and you set it up really nice and cosy
Mm
And then er
We got a lot we got a quite a lot of these little blue tables so you could actually
Yeah
surround the dance floors
Oh yes
No no
but we
messing
push you know push people into the dance floor so they're there anyway
Yeah and you make a totally you make a totally different er m it's it in one sort of minor operation if you like alright minor to a
Mm
certain extent you've totally transformed it Barry
Mm
And it it
That's right
definitely looks so different
I mean even if you didn't do anything else
Mm
But I think er m you've just got to er we've just got to er ger r it sorted
Ititit int gonna take much sorting and get the you know
Mm
We could use that chrom e railing around
Well you co
are a
yeah you could use that chrom e railing elsewhere we could
Mm
you know
I don't think you you've you've got to try in a way not to shut it off too much er m and yet it i you've just got to sort of be able to not shut it off but sort of create different areas
Mm
within one big are a i i if you can and I think shutting things I think putting trellis ing up to not trellis ing but that sort of thing to a certain extent at the minute we don't need and I think I'll have to come a time er too when it's open as well to get
Now wha what I was just thinking of
Yes
But it could be just on a Saturday and Sun
is it if you if you're using if you're gonna use it as a pub as well
Mm
on a Saturday and a Sunday
Mm
which I think you can do with Am er certainly in the summer season if you American i ze it and all that and and just well I mean we we did
You could have a glorious MacDonald s couldn't you
Yeah
That's right
Then you know you wanna start from that and build back out bits
Yeah
you know
Definitely
cos I mean if they walked into here on stood on that bar hundred and twenty people
Well actually you don't want them you want them in here and bar's there
Well that's right
And that's the bar they use
Yeah
Yeah
That's right
You don't sort of use
No we have that closed and
Yeah
and try and sort
Yeah
of shutter it off in some
Yeah
way
I mean maybe
Well I think
maybe even getting literally shutters rather than those grill s
And then you can
No I think I think I think
I tell you what we had Laura Jean's daughter had er m a nurses' dinner here it was about the they wanted to come on a on a disco night but
Mm
they wanted a meal beforehand
Yeah
Yeah

that I'd need it he'll be going in in with bloody mob if I'd have done it
Stupid he is
What did Fred talk him into all this for the blame won't he
Talking him into there's not no they don't got to be doing meals or ow t upstairs
No
Mind you then maybe that comes with time of year mind you I'm not doing any either
So
Having said that I you know I mean i i i ex c i if he's not gonna do that
Well even if he
or even if he even if he is doing that he's not gonna he's not gonna
I mean cos you've gotta do it better than him
do it very well
Er m
But I think if if same as er
Carlton is far too big for the Abbe y
I mean like our cricket club dinner I mean we have it's usually between sort of eighty and a hundred and twenty people but
Mm
I mean we must they must spend twenty quid a head at the bar
Mm
at least
We could get them here nicely
Yeah
Be absolutely
But we but we go to the Carlton well so
Mm
I've been to
I mean we've been all round but the last three years we've stayed at Carlton
Mm
I said he's done a pretty good job
Yeah
But there's no reason why you don't do you know
But I I tell you really you'd you'd and something different because I mean like you go to the Headway and it's just the same
Yeah
the beer's bloody awful
Well the other thing that's really good is cos you've all got that set up cos it is a disco
Yeah
you don't have to upset people
Charge it i
and
No
bring gear in while they're eating and be setting
Nonono no no
up and
No no messing about no
testing the equipment and all that sort of stuff
Nonono
No you see it's all there
I think
The D J
that's
plays background music while you're eating
While you're eating
and then winds it up when you
Yeah
when you want you know
When you want yeah
Mm
Yeah
It makes makes it you know and then we jus you just ah have we'll just have I mean ceiling 's right in blue so I mean
Mm
you know
What sort of paint is it that
Well these damn these bloody til es cost a fortune
They say just I mean we yo th there's bits and pieces of like you know
Yeah I mean
like you have to redo some of til es but a lot of them
Er excuse me
Ooh
Pardon me
And even things like the cocktail side I mean although you never use it it's a bit of a joke I mean it actually fits into American bit dunn it
Ah yeah it's American if i ed yeah course it well you can make co you could make cocktails
Oh I know you could yeah
without no messing couldn't you
Not expensive ones either
Mm
Yeah could have one of these
Manhattan Transfer s are nice though
That I remembered what they call that place at White cross they call Damn Yankee
I'm going to er m
White cross
At Guise ley
Oh
I'm gonna next door to our Rams den 's Fish and Chip shop
Ohoh is it
Well what I'm gonna do is I'm go
He's opened one in London at Heathrow Airport
Yeah
There's one in Black pool now
Is there
They used to be absolutely beautiful there but they're crap now
Well that's
or whatever it is
That's the problem inn it
I mean one yo yo be you get good because of the reputation of doing something and and the one person
And and one person doing it yeah
doing it and then because you're good everybody comes and you cease to do it you're upstairs doing the books instead
Mm
No not me
and you employ staff
sunshine
I
Ah
don't do books
No but you know what I mean I mean you get
Rob does the books
pulled away from the
Mm
actual
Yes
what you're good at
Yes
on to other staff
And it's very difficult to get other people to do it like you want it
Oh yeah
That's right
So if we got er m yeah so yeah that I'll I'll er m I'll get Brenda to go get me a rec er ma menu and send me it
Cos more you get it's easier to
Is it
Bloody hell it's cold
I know
Yeah
Get in er m
Hugh do you know Anne
Anne
Yeah
Hug hey
Yeah we've met we we meet on a Friday night love don't we
When there's only me in company that's sober
Yeah she comes she comes up yeah
Yeah
Wha what
No er customers Friday I didn't mean er
Yeah
Anne's just saying we er m ought to pull that whole sta dance floor out and have it all flat floored
Flat
Yeah
And you could then do something that's
That's more American anyway
Yeah
Yeah
And I mean you can create a dance floor by the tables and just lighting round it
I mean that's all it as I say I don't know why I didn't think of it cos in the she well I do know why I didn't think of
Why don't we make that like a rebel fort
That would be that
Like the Alamo you mean
Yeah
The thing blows out of it
Yeah
Arrows stuck in it
Are we er m
Oh no not at all
No that isn't what I nonono
No no
Yeah I know
But as I say if you took that out you create a massive empty space then
Yeah well i it makes it it
then you can
makes it so that you can you see the other thing what's your name
Hug hey again
Hugh Hugh yeah
Oh right
Well we were just thinking about functions you see
Yeah
well as it is now you you know you really don't wanna be half of them up there and half of them down here on a table
And you could get so many in on the thing
I think you have I I sort of
And then just li no the whole floor
Cos well the floor can be a disco anyway like you know
It's not a disco disco you know what I mean
You know
No
No
No
No
I mean l in
Yeah something
I me
nearly
for the sake of for the sake of a few bands that we do I mean most of the bands on the local level are used to playing in pub s so they just had to play on the floor anyway and the rest of it
Well it's a bloody ego who needs the stage
And any any major names you could always if you need if it was that big yo and important
They'd be at the wouldn't they
No but
Well that'd be
No but I mean you could get a a stage in
Pull a stage in
stage in from across the er across the way
Just temporary
Yeah
staging that's put in and cast away
Well where do you find that
That break and special tie it at the back of there
Yeah
Doesn't make sense but oh I dunno
I know
I dunno you can't see his head
my little sweetie pie
The horrible little int there
Well you know once he once he's once he's resigned himself to not getting this back
Is there no chance of it
What of him getting this back
No
Not now no not
Pigs can fly can they
now not Ellie l
Da I mean once he sort of re I mean that's why all the fuss with Jean stopped because that
Yeahbut a thing like
Was it
that is it's just that Mr who really didn't know anything from his and needle and thread was stirring the shit
No she's been getting enough of that
But once he's once he's resigned himself to that he's then gotta look at that operation next door and he must be losing money hand over fist for the amount of space it is
That's right
He to take out all these walls outright the way back
And is it just
and it's as big as this
And you've got
Back to that wall
M hm
Mm
I mean it's a co it's almost a bloody conference centre to be honest
Mind you though
You could you could seat if you did sort of classroom seating in there a room this size in that er you could you could probably seat six hundred people
Not as many as the Do me
Even at six hundred
Not a quarter
Yeah
I mean it's a Do me and a bit
I told Angie today that we're gonna extend
Oh did you
Yeah
He said he could do them himself because I'm not having
They were gonna charge er m
Mention it
Oh
Well be fucking
Yeah well the t ro he sa
Lights
It's the lighting isn't it
So er m
Mm
Need to get a whole batch of these ti
Mm

Who
These til es
Yeah
Cos they're
That's what
multi
deaf in it
Oh are you
Yeah I am actually
Ha
Hi
I can't hear you I can't hear men usually
It's only it's only screaming women I can hear
Well we er
No but it's really embarrassing sometimes cos I I have to look at men cos
Yeah
when they're talking som I'm sure they think I'm bloody crazy
And read their lips
And that I'm in love with him or something
Yeah
Yeah no I can't understand that
No just
Er m no we need we need to get a whole load of ne er til es cos the whole club wants re - t i l i n g n o t re - t i l i n g but there's a whole are a areas and that
And po and poly s ty rene
And and they're the wrong you know if you're gonna if you're gonna redecorate the whole thing you need to er m you need to you know
Yeah
Well yeah
You don't need
No what I said
three diff four different kinds of blue in the roof and things like that
Well not really
They're awful things to paint aren't they
A do you do them rounds or whats pr a can't you spray them
Hug hey does them I don't know
How do you do them
How do you do them
Just stick the brush on them
You have
Right
to work with what you've got
Well that's true
A man's only as good as the
Yes I know
tools he's given
Yeah
Oh yeah I quite like that idea with them all like that
What
Yes definitely
I think the punters would appreciate it as well
Yeah
Hello
Yeah
No not yet yeah
Okay
Oh right
That's right
Yes it is three thirty
Okay
It's just a matter of er i I mean all we need to do isisis sort out a sort of formal agreement with Ellie l that you know and how how the management company or the limited company's going to sort of manage the place and th then we'll er got to you know we've got two people who've got a a very successful business they're actually drinks ' suppliers More cam be Bay Wines and Spirits er who are gonna come in and have er they'll sign the cheque for the rent there and then I mean it's er it's a matter of just th you know all it is is is they're saying well you know what actually is the formal arrangement
And we're sort of saying we haven't actually got round to formal iz ing it yet
Er Mm
Right
Right
Yes
Yeah
Er m er well Jean's got the exact figures er she'sshe's done it all she's got it all all down for for for this afternoon
Er mI don't know I've written it down
And th on the cherish you and whatever else and th er mI mean we've already got a situation where we've got er m through Peter and David the other two I mean we've got er m er m two or three brewer i es who are quite willing to er m to give us quite a substantial amount of money not as loans as write - o f f s against barrel age er m which means that we don't have any re payments to make et cet era
So they're effectively sort of grants and ye in in that way
Er m mm no you just play it yo well you he yes and no I mean i er you you you were ge you were getting in pr a i the equivalent of thirty pound a barrel discount er m which is probably as much as you could er could get er in in in a free free house any er except that you've got you know fifteen twenty thousand pounds up front as a payment to you
Er m the company is More cam be Bay Wines and Spirits
Er m and this is going to sound stupid but I don't know their second names
Peter and David are the two er m they're up to yeah
Right
Okay
Er m it's just to two of them and er
Well that but your main areas will be gonna be before
So
What
we're just saying main area's
You ought to save them wooden type of things for it
You know the
Yeah
Yeah
Should have bought them for
Ve er yeah I mean it's it's
Are they expensive though
expensive it is very expensive
Well you could have your dance floor actual dance floor whatever couldn't you
And then something
Mm
Well it's
You can make it different like and make it sort of still a dance are a
Yeah
Something like they have at Chapel
Yeah what have they got down in there
Just the wooden floor
It's just just a little a little sort of parquet
Small
floor ing type of thing
Oh
That type of floor yeah
And carpet all round it and just a
Oh it's carpet is it round
Yeah
it
But it's only a tiny are a
Yeah but
isn't it
Yeah
But as I say in the Sugar House so we I mean we've ju we all we did was was we the mass the big central are a we just literally sort of li no type floor and carpet ed round the edges
Round the edge
and into the bar are a
And it's a ma I mean you get four hundred people on the dance floor in the Sugar House
Er m
Where is this Sugar House
It's in er m
In Lancaster
behind Waring and Gill ow
How do you get to that
Say the rest of us didn't know where it was
Up up the alleyway by the York s hire you got York s hire House there
Ah
Yes
Waring and Gill ow and it's up that alleyway there
Oh is it in there
It's it was the architects ' department er m till they go like you know till they Pal a tine Hall er mit used to be the architects ' department
We bought it off the city well Michelin bought it off the city council and they ga z ump ed us and er m but we we have tables and chairs on to the dance floor on other nights and just pull them back when it's clear
Yes
Saturday night there's gonna
Yeah
be a thousand people in
That's how we used to do it
Ah yeah
So er can they get yeah they get eleven twelve
How many's
Er I think they le it's nine hundred
The
isn't it
Is the like legal limit
They've they put like twelve thirteen
on a night
they've put twelve thirteen hundred in
But when when they can but you've ju i in the Empire if you if you've I don't know actually i before they before they messed about with all the raised seating and everything if it had been just left open like the Old Flora l Hall like it was you'd have got seventeen
I know
eighteen hundred in
With a balcony
Er m I mean as an ol as the Old Flora l Hall they must have had
Mm mm
they must have been putting two thousand in you know
Yeah
in those days
Yeah
Yeah
Well I mean they'll all be packed up in the bars upstairs wouldn't they and everything
Yeah
you know leaning over the balcony and all that sort of er
Yeah
Mm
But I'd er I'd you know the way they've the way they've got it now I don't I don't know
Well
But you know i I mean actually the other the other aspect of it Anne if you if you pull this out you could be talking about hosting small conferences and that
Yeah
couldn't you
Definitely
Cos if you're looking at a two hundred capacity conference for er
Yeah
Easy - p e a s y
No messing
Ma that that just makes the total picture just different altogether
So right so that's that little job
You
sorted out
probably need to
I'm

I'm gonna play with that and see what
probably need to get Ken 's per
we can do with it then
probably need to get Ken 's permission

Obnoxious little man int he
He's like a ferret
Mm
I get on very well with him though
So what is so there's nothing to the other side just apart from this big room
Yeah
But and a bar
What and that in there

So that's that one
There's a massive room with twelve s no ok er twelve s no ok er tables

Grant ham
They're treating ba
Got to have a look at this
they're treating alcohol as food

So all the hygiene things on food apply to alcohol
Oh I know that
So you can't handle you can't handle
You're gonna have to have somebody else to take the money won't you
Fucking cashier
You'll have to have a cashier

You can't do it though
You can't have yo it'd mean one to serve and one take the money
It's fucking ridiculous
Say if you're if you're really busy at the bar just taking your gloves off and fucking putting them on
Oh aye you're gonna do it aren't you
Well what we'll do is we'll do we'll just have a pump at the side of the till

Somebody took me to see one of their pub s in Liverpool it was wonderful
Where the shutters are
Yeah
all just hard board like that with just a little O like that and you you you shout a pint of beer and you pushed your money through and then a beer ca came out the other side
Bet it was er m
It was rough
Yeah
Waste of time though inn it
It was a bit of a rough are a
What type of beer are you getting
No and a pint of sherry
Yeah and plastic glasses as well
Yeah
Oh my
Great
I mean the only way you could do that would be if you had a till at one end and people bought whatever they wanted and were given a voucher and you walked down the other end and exchanged
Mm
it for drink
That's the only way you could actually make that work at all
Yeahbut just think of how much messing about there is
Ah
It'd be unbelievable
I mean it'd be two th i forty we'd be round the bloody bend
Yeahbut it's somebody sitting in an office inn it deciding this
Yeahbut who who do you you know why
Sitting in a suit in a nice office saying wo
This is a good idea
You know they don't serve behind the bar on a Saturday night
They want somebody here from the for half an hour and them not being served first
Here
You know what happens d'ya know what happens then they'll get people
like
Yeah
People will get so ant is ep tic that they'll not be able to stand any sort of germs of any sort
That's
Yeah
true that
I mean you think about all this I mean a load of crap when they have la r der s and all that

In that case if this Thursday ge get anything like the other Thursdays we've got enough to last
Is there a book for that like
Er Webb Webb missed the first one blasted it over the top and Gig g s missed one at the end
They scored all theirs and Gig g s had to score his
Oh yeah
to make them
So that they could miss the last one
Yeah
I mean
Fucking awful
This fucking stuff they put down
Well yeahbut it's the police 's fault inn it
Yeah
You know I mean it it's bloody outrageous that the police can dictate you know something F A Cup 's been there for
I know
Bastards
hundreds of years and police can dictate the what you're gonna do
Don't be silly
Yeah
May as well
So they're a bit sticky
Nearly broke my neck on one pulling one one of those crates out
Pulling this
Yeah
Yeah they'll be fucking
Oh actually you can smell the bleach now can't you
Yeah
Are you gonna do them all
Yeah
May as well
Fucking no more cos they'll all be here for four o'clock
Probably forgotten p i the line cleaners
I did write it down for her in the list
All this thing in the press and on the T V about Kevin K e ag an being a folk hero in Newcastle He
I know
How
He
long did he play for them
he only played there two years
Yeah
Two seasons
Two seasons
I mean I can't believe that he's I mean
Fuck
O s sie's had a hard game likeS wind on
Oh yeah
being promoted and then
I know
somebody taking the fucking
That's awful
points off them
What have they th they ducked three points as it is
No they've put them down in third division now
Yeah originally they'd have ducked for three
Yeah Yeah
points and
Yeah
stopped and then prefer to go like when they appealed because he'd knocked them again
I mean you know how long's he when did he get the job May or something last year
I mean he's hardly you know he's had
Yeah
half a season I mean that's ridiculous
And then the vote of confidence he'll be there
Oh God
How the fuck can he do that
I know
Every time they do it don't they you know
I know
Yeah
He er especially when the chairman says he's got every faith in him
You know you're gonna a er a telegram the next morning
Outrageous that
I wondered when they offered K e ag an to do it
Yeah
I fucking watched the programme on that Who Who's the Greatest
It was about fucking sports men of the week and it was K e ag an and George Best
Oh I I remember that I didn't watch it I refused to watch it
I mean that's actually going in for K e ag an
I think fucking Dennis Taylor was on singing his praises
Singing whos eKe ag an 's praises
Yeah
I think it was Dennis Taylor Taylor
That's a that was difference yo you end up voting you end up actually voting who's the nicest human being not
Yeah
really
Exactly
That's why it was cos he's
not the best football er
you know dedicated to his club and all this
Yeah
stuff
But I mean he he wasn't
He's a
particularly was he
I mean he went to Liverpool Liverpool made him
That's right
Yeah
from S cun thor pe and then I mean he he went after mega bucks in in er m
Ham burg
Ham burg then you know so being a big fish in a small pond at Southampton and then
But
last couple of years a quick I mean his contract with Newcastle worth worth a fortune wasn't it
Cos it was one of those first ones that was sponsored by
Who was
the
it
the brewery
Was it
wasn't it
was it Pools
No
It was ere rm wasn't it New ce y brown ale went and sponsored Newcastle
No no
But anyway I mean they er they ended up instead of paying the club a sponsor ship they ended up paying him you know like er m
Yeah
like the car phone company did with
Yeah
I an Both am to go to Wo rc ester s hire
But he wasn't the fucking greatest oh hardworking I'd say he fucking
Oh yeah
grafted
Yeah
That's right
He wasn't a
He wasn't that
he wasn't a very skilful player
No
He wasn't a natural at all
He worked hard though
Yeah
He had a he had a he had a a lot he had a he was quite nip p y and he had a good s cu you know good goal
Good goals
scoring sense
Yeah
sometimes but I mean that was all
He was a good player but I but I think he's always looked after himself I mean he's he's
Yeah
he's probably one of
Oh yeah
the richest British foot ballers
He will be
Yeah
I can't think anybody would have more
No
No
I mean it it no he was one of the first with the shrewd sort of business sense
Yeah
and all that
Fucking Mick 's making a fortune training at Arsenal
Is he
Doing really well yeah
And Francis he's doing quite
Yeah
well
Didn't he used to be in scrap metal is what Francis was
Toilet rolls
telling me
Is it
Oh
Did you see er m This Is Your Life last night
No
It was Alan B le as dale
Oh
The
Ah

Yeah
And they had they had er Kenny D al g lei sh and Graham So u ness and er
All the Liverpool like
Yeah
And they had er tt er m Reed
Peter Reed
Yeah
Cos he used to Alan B le as dale used to be Peter Reed's teacher at school and the
Did he
Yeah
A and er m he he coached the football te
He would be bun king off
he coached the football team the the
What place is that then
the Kirby Boys and they won the national competition or something or other with the with them
Noth the till man said we have to keep er m you know the receipt one
Yeahbut we never put that on do we
I know
But we need to keep er a a receipt in it
Because
And just have it so it's not
Yeah
Yeah
So th there's a switch inside on off
Yes yes I know that
He said fa because er m one of the keys is damaged er m the b ot you know when the you know the printout
Yeah
when it prints out the bottom of like the nought s and the bottom of the figure is missing you can read it it's not important but it's done because the one it wo it's punching on to on to metal because that paper's not on our till receipt
See that thing you had whe when the bar was taken this time was that just for tax like
No that was that was our er that was our accounts for the year
Does Vol ks actually know that yeah
Yeah
I think Vol ks just wanted out of the are a to be honest
Yeah well
Don't care
they're further further up north aren't they now
Mm
Well they've got the depot at Roch dale which services up to Black pool and this was out on a limb
Yeah
Cos i it K end al's done from Newcastle
Is it
Yeah
Up to there
Oh course
Yeah
and then Roch dale up towards Black pool and we're stuck right in the bloody middle so the er they were a like we were one delivery that's all it and we weren't that big an account you know even doing a reasonable trade you're not
Yeah
for one pub
Yeah well they they you obviously need twothree that like to make it worth your while
Yeah
It's getting a bit fucking rank you know
Now d'ya know how dirty those shelves get
Mind you the c ra crates are fairly dirty aren't they at times
Yeah
That's what does it
On the bottoms as well
Yeah you sometimes get them some of them look as if there's I dunno vin ta vintage Newcastle Brown you know cobwebs and dust on them int there and spiders ' web s on them
I hope Saturday's as good as last Saturday it was quite a good night that
Well IIII honestly thought the bar should have done and I'm sure it fucking did you know
Didn't have enough people in to do anything else
I dunno
We'd have had they'd have had to spent about five quid a head
Yeah but they were
Like the shorts were absolutely hammered
Like there were them lads they had fucking four in a glass like and there was loads of so many drinks like I served loads
Vo d vodka Jack Daniels and some other spirit in it
I ju I just wanna know how much Terri took you know
Yeah
I'll have a look
Like er m I'm like I'm not fucking saying to she'sshe's but she's she just gets fucking absolutely stupid
It's really silly like
Like and you know that is it Al is Alison and somebody
She's always on about Alison like I'm sure she fucking doesn't charge them for drinks
Well which one's Alison
She's er she always comes looking for Terri
She's going with that little monster with the long hair
Played in the band here once and they
Aha
were crap or something
Kevin er Kevin I think his name is
She's just though she's fucking outrageous
She doesn't know what she's doing half the time
Like you go even saying I did serve quite a bit faster than her which I do like you know she still should o i if the bar done seven fifty she should have she should have done what twothree and a half
Oh yeah
At least like
Well she I mean she might have done it
She should have done a bit more than that actually
Mm
She should have been doing three hundred
Still leaves me a hundred and fifty ahead of her like you know
Like you didn't serve any drinks did you Barry
No
No
Er
So all
twenty twenty quid 's worth maybe at the end
Not much
If it's gonna be like that we do need a glass collector don't we
We need somebody on to collect glasses
But er there wasn't really any even though it was quite wewewe did have quite a lot of glasses
Mind you they would have gone and broke if we line them up
Yeahbut Ka Kat rin wasn't Kat rin wasn't
She'd got nooh that's right yeah
You know
Well that's another thing I think that black man as well is getting drinks as well
Mind you you wouldn't mind you'd give him a couple like if you
Yeah
help us you
No
know like
Well that's right I mean you know two or two or three drinks to us is only costing like a quid well it's only a quid
Yeahbut she's been caught doing it as well
Ach
It's not the point Jean put o said to me last week about the fucking
Like and there's other people in there that are you know they should be wrote down and she looked at me
Yeah
like
Yeah
Oh yeah I mean they're gonna have to be from now on cos we're not gonna be you know we're gonna be responsible to
Yeah
somebody else not just ourselves you know
Okay if we wa if we want to turn a blind eye to it then that's our business you know but er but when you're when you're actually er m
Answer able to someone else
Yeah
Present accounts to somebody else you can't do it like that can you
You know water's looking disgusting
What other results were there last night
Er Forest
The
won four two
Oh did they
Doing really well
Liverpool drew one each with Bristol Rover s
That don't sound right
I've seen it seen that one I've seen that match they were lucky
S under land won who were they playing
S under land won
Er Oxford I think
They were winning three n il three two at the end of it
Oxford scored one on the end
Not many first division teams left is there
Nine
About nine is there
W rex ham were unlucky against Black burn
Oh
Weren't they
Didn't they play well
Yes
They've always been a
I thought they played
good club side W rex ham
Yeah they have but I mean they got a lot of good skilful young lads haven't they
They're only like nineteen and twenty
Yeah
and I mean that young full back looked brilliant
That le f
Yeah
Mm mm
Quite good
Composed as well like
Talented
Yeah
It's a funny law that er clear chance at goal job inn it
I mean it's a funny definition
I must admit I I if you could stop that deliberate foul it's I mean it's better for the game if you can stop it
Send them off
Yeah
Yeah
That's right
I mean if you're gonna do it
Yeah
do it do it do it
Yeah
consistently
Cos actually the other thing about defenders hauling people down like that you know how many times when a for ward's through one on one on a goal keeper does he score
It's not that often actually
No
I mean okay somebody like Best y
Thing you want
you could bet on
Yeah
nine times out of ten but
But even even against the goal keeper they fucking lose fifty percent of the like
Yeah
I was saying more than fifty percent of the playing
Yeah I would yeah
Yeah
Yeah
And that's all just one on one on the goal keeper
Yeah
Well that's what I mean I mean you know th th the player could let him could let him go really without deliberately fouling him because it's it's gonna
Half the
be at least a fifty fifty
Yeah
chance that the goal keep er's gonna save it inn it
It's fucking gotta be straight like that I I I don't fucking taking off three points for a
At the start it seemed to improve the matches but it they've just become too hectic now I think
Mm
You know there's not as much skill involved as there was
No
No that's right
It's
Like the
incredibly passed
the first the first season like the football did seem to improve but it's not
That's right
gonna go back now I think
United have got a strange side at the moment though
Oh yes
I mean I don't think you can it's alright having all these players but if you he doesn't seem
They don't play
he doesn't seem to
They
have an idea of what he wants
Cos I mean
No they don't
every week he's got a different sort of format
Well what's he supposed to do
Gig g s Semen
Well he had him
Well I think he's gotta look at and the team should be in with you
Yeah
like
He had him playing yesterday er but they dropped Hughes
Yeah I know
Well you don't drop Hughes for anybody
And his two subs Hughes and Sharp I mean it does rather hamstring
Yeah
you if anything happens to a central defender dunn it
Yeah
Well I don't think Hughes should ever be sub like he should be on the team
Well that's right even if he's not scoring goals he's creating so much pressure and and
Yeah he always done like
Good in defence as well
Yeah
That's right
Well he's also sum mater I mean he's he's one of the best at holding a ball you know
Fantastic shielding the ball
on his own
Yeah
Yeah
Whit b reads are here
Arsenal
Yeah
played well
Yeah
The crowd were getting at them last night
Were they
The first goal was dreadful
My did you see it
They were winning three n il weren't they
Yeah
Did you see this goal
No
I remember seeing but I heard fucking result on News at Ten
It was a long
I know
it was a it was full pass inside to two full backs er for the Southampton player that was running on this full back shaded it away you know guiding him out of it he's running to the e sa S me ich el came out to the edge of the are a but he was like right on the edge as the player was coming to him so he just let it roll a little bit further he stopped it with his foot the guy came and tackled him off got it instead of just picking it up with his hand I mean he was actually in the are a but like he was right on the edge and he took a step back
Why the fuck didn't he
and stopped it with his foot
Yeah
wait for the ball coming in
I tell you Liverpool were really lucky cos er Bristol Rover s had got a penalty
Mm
As long they as long as they win the league I do I don't mind
Been a long time
Mind you
I know
Leeds are still bloody doing well though
They won three n il last week didn't they
Yeah
Oh every week they putting it together scoring the goals
I think they were about a hundred and fifty to one I'm standing see if they can win the league
Are they
Yeah
Yeah
Wouldn't be a bad that actually cos if it did
Yeah they played well the year before they held their own see they've got all the
They played last year didn't they
the best lads
Yeah
I mean they're they ended up about what were they about fifth or something weren't they
Yeah last year
Aha
And they bought er players didn't they
They put you know started to buy a few you know like Dore go and things like that
Wallace not a bad buy
Arsenal are playing terrible aren't they
Mm
Ro e castle's started to play well again this
Yeah
It was an awful goal that United gave away weren't it
We I mean it was only Pa last er in in that half

Women are twelve times more likely than men to get AIDS from straight sex by

She does what she
You wouldn't just think about it it's just gone isn't it
Yeah
You got to be quick

I mean I don't know
You see they've got to be seen taking it out
Yeah outside the door
Yeah that's right
Get them outside
Outside the door yeah that's right
Stop em and have the stuff on them

Where do they where do they take the pound
To the till desk

They had three on on door I mean three security men but it's not worth it mind
And on a Saturday with Jenny going in if there's any overtime you and old what's - a - n a m e was there and he came and tapped me on the shoulder

Yeah
Off you go

Mm
Mm
Bristol Mecca they had a bloody bomb scare and we had to tip out
and they had all these great pads you know and I had all these maternity pads because I needed them you know I had to pad up and I had to and I felt so embarrassed
I know some of these security men are worse than the bloody people who goes in and out there you know
They knows the layout don't they
Course they do
That's it
It's easier
It's stupid
I could do it if I had the face and I had the guts I could do it
I don't no way
I could I know about there if I really want to but no way I could do it
Caroline went out there at Christmas and look at what she had
Mm
And she went back and back again till she got caught
Mm
Oh she got caught
Hundreds of pounds
You see people that think they got cameras out there they can't see
I didn't know
But they are there they've even got them in the warehouse
Have they
Because he likes to see what's going on all the time
Yeah
Well my sister over there was two women
For years they went on and on and on and everything they took and that was from eight o'clock in the morning was either from Marks and Spencer s or British Home Stores
Yeah good stuff yeah
And our had loads and loads of stuff and because it's it was red hot so she could fold it up and say
Yeah that's it
Yeah it was red hot
they had beautiful clothes and they've gone on for years like that
They had taxi in taxi out
Anyway they got they got in the end and they
He run the corner shop isn't he
He goes up every year and nicks what he wants for Christmas for the kids
And they'd wear different wigs every day
Yeah
Different wigs
For a couple of years on the run they've lost their do le cheque round about Christmas
Oh yes they always lose their do le cheque very conveniently at Christmas
Eh
And they got to go down and get another one
Yeah they do that same stroke every bloody Christmas that Christmas
There's no way
I just couldn't
No I couldn't my money all the time
I had the a couple of musical teddy bears put by
I don't know whether you've seen them
They're about this big and you squeeze its little paw and it plays a Christmas tune
Oh yeah
And I said to Chris I'll have two of them
One brown one one white one one each of the bears then
And er m she said all right and I said what do I do with them and she said I'll put them down in the base at the back and I said all right so I went back on the shop floor just before I was coming out come out
I went darling to one of the girls and she said yeah I said will you come with me and she said what's the matter
I said I want to get my teddy bears out of the back
She said go now to the electrical desk and you can pay for them when no I don't want to do that and I made her come out with me and see I picked up those ted dies in the bags and I went back in and put them by the electrical desk
Yes I see yes
I said that's how you got to do it and then I come round and pick them up when
I mean when you think of those
She said oh what a fuss
I said yeah but at least I know
There's no way I've touched anything else out of the cupboard you know
And yet the stores is covered for any er m one who pinches and that
But then er m they haven't got the guts to things
I mean if I
What do you want
Although I wouldn't I wouldn't
If my kids was over here I'd have to flog something
Oh I know
I couldn't steal I couldn't steal
I'd have to flog something
Now don't start because I'm going out
I'm not
You are
Now David that's quite enough be a good boy
Well don't worry about it Bet it'll be all right
It's wonderful
I don't know whether I'm coming or going
I'm hungry
I thought you were on nights this week
Oh I am
Doing two to ten Friday
That's tomorrow
Yeah
Why you doing two to ten tomorrow
Because she said she don't want to come in on nights
She asked everybody and she said will you come in on two to ten
Mm
They bounced up their little list
Oh Maggie
We can depend on you to come in on Sunday can't we
No
Oh aye yeah no
No
She said it's double time
Aye er m yeah
I said couldn't care less if it's triple time I'm not coming in on a Sunday
I said I see enough of this place all bleeding week I'm not coming in on a Sunday
Oh dear
He'd go bleeding mad
Well I mean er
One day I have a lie in I mean I know I don't lay in there no more than eight
No but you know you don't have to worry about getting up have you
Well I said I sort of t run d le down the stairs and have me breakfast
Well that's it that's it
I said no bloody way am I working on a Sunday
I said these daft bugger s that come in and do it it's up to them
I don't know I don't know
I suppose if people wants to go to the shopping centre s they
I wouldn't go to the shops on Sunday
No I wouldn't
I wouldn't go on a Sunday
I mean there's seven days in the week isn't there
I mean I mean how can people afford to do it Bet
I mean
I mean to my mind if they're opening on a Sunday they should bring their prices down because they're opening that extra day they're going to be taking extra revenue
Yeah of course they are
So they should be made to bring their prices down
That is why they put that freeze on
That is why that man said you will not get any more special offers on a F r i Saturday night because they can't sell it on a Sunday so you used to see them selling things off on a Saturday five o'clock
No more
Because they're opening on a Sunday and hoping that you'll go in
That's it
Mm
and buy
So you won't be able to find out nothing
You won't forget that
And I reckon they'll carry on down to Christmas
Well they reckon that the British Standard people are going to have
It's got to be tumble dried
it's going to be a dry day get it out early and get it dry tomorrow
Mm
What way do you think Clayton will come then
What way
Yeah
I was going to lock the back door make sure that down
Why
Because because she keeps on coming in
to pay your money
Yeah
Get a washing machine on the firm
She said if you pay up which isn't very much er m there's something in Little woods and she's got money in her pocket and she's got a washing machine
That's great
will be paying her nowhere near as much
That will be fine great brilliant
That's what she said
She said it's none of my business
She wants washing machine
Because if I can I'd rather get it off her than get it out of our club because then I can get some Christmas presents out of their lot
Yeah
Do you or you can say to her is I don't know where it's gone or it doesn't work
out of her catalogue
Yeah
Well they just went back and said they couldn't want something that much maybe she's gone over her limit
Yeah
That's right
gone over her limit and I'm not interested in her amount
oh you turned it off
No I haven't
You have

Here you are
all you'd have had to get is all you'll have had to get is an element
That's the thing that so easy with electric cook er s is that you just have to buy the element
So with that if one of them goes you just have to buy that as an element just slot it it comes it's like a light bulb
Oh I see take it out and
Slots slots out and you slot another one in
Oh I see
It's a lot easier with gas
Our mum's several times her rings has gone on her cook er she's had to buy a new element and she's switched to gas

Oh I
It's half past eight we'd better chase it up
myself
Into Neighbours again
bank
I'm not allowed to touch it
Why
Because someone in America is vegetarian
Yeah
And when that girl becomes vegetarian mix about and the other one she's vegetarian still and she said she's not coming back in this house
She said it's nonsense
It's good for them though
Yeah but what they've what they've done but what one wants to do is not is not bad for them one little bit
It's good for them
That's like what's her name down the down there
She's vegetarian three months ago er three years ago
But they worked out in three years she's put on seven stone because she eats
She eats loads and loads and loads of cheese
She buys four pounds of cheese a week
And she eats a load of cheese
Yeah but if she was proper vegetarian she wouldn't eat cheese
Well if she was a v egan she wouldn't eat cheese
She can't eat cheese if you're a v egan
That's what James is
He's a pr at
You can't eat no animal fat at all
Yeah
You've got the so u I reckon you've still got to have er get your protein
Mm
Yes
Yeah but she Karen won't eat chicken
Chicken and fish
and fish
It's the only stuff they'll eat
No meat at all chicken and er fish
Do you know the reason why it's not
It's to do with red meat it's blood isn't it
Blood's red
That's right isn't it
You can't you can't see no blood in chicken you can't see no blood in fish
No
They've got this little thing in their head if it's not got blood in it no red blood they can eat it
It looks like it's a really deep cut by looking at it now
It's sort of like open there
All it was first of all was a little graze on top of the skin
Mm
Because where I was making boxes it was pulling the skin and was torn apart wasn't it
Yeah it kept going there all the time
They do though don't it
So the other day last week I was bleeding
Was you
Yeah I cut myself
And er m the next day I had er it was all white there
Was it
and I took every little last bit out
But I never noticed it er
Serious
It was not funny because what I did
I was cleaning out knives and the metal thing that goes over the knives there was something there and it was a nail and I just pushed and I caught it
So I took a nick out of my finger and ended up with from the top of my finger
Mm
Nasty
blood enough goes over my fingers cut his thumb and and all he did was just sort of bathed it put on it
It was a deep cut and ended up
And a good cover up job
It didn't make it heal just good stuff
And she was m hm
Mm
Yeah
She was had on a full stomach
She had to do it before she ate anything
She said most of it was it wasn't the actual looking at the hole it was that she was hurting him pushing it in
Mm
And it weren't hurting him at all but it was making her feel sick thinking that she was hurting him like
Dunno
He just won't go
It being her first child
I don't know what I'd be like
And he sleeps in a normal bed
Do he
Yes
That's good for a baby
He sleeps in a normal bed all right
She was packing his stuff and I was bringing him upstairs to his room like away from her like
Like he knows she's in the house and he wants to go wherever she goes
But if she's not in the house it doesn't worry him
If he knows she's not there
So I can go upstairs and put him in his rocking chair
rocking chair
Well there's not a lot I said to her does he sleep in that
It's a full size single bed
And she said yeah
I said bloody hell
I never knew a child of one could sleep in a normal size bed
cot yeah
Well no
She must leave his door shut
She's bound to isn't is
She puts on the alarm like one of those baby alarms

That's it
Got to be
And she's got to go downstairs to the kitchen
He was trying to go upstairs last night cos she was upstairs and I wouldn't let him
You do think those bloody stairs
As soon as she was upstairs
He knew that she was up there I let him sort of try and climb up
Well he climbed up the bloody first sta i r
Like he was behind er I never held him I was behind him like you know well it gives his legs a bit more like movement
Who's that who was on the telephone

That'll be it
she'll have to keep an eye on him then
Yes hard work isn't it
You should have seen him he climbed on top of a box last night to get to the telly

He'll sit there on the floor with them and play with the magnets
He chucks them off and puts them back on again
Very intelligent little baby isn't he

I thought whatever's that dancing around in the bedroom
And it was Clay he's dancing through here dancing through there and dancing back dancing back
He said I would have asked you if I had had any trying to find trousers awake
So he had to wear his and he don't like doing that because it gets stuck in the locker
What time did you come down this morning then Bet
Me
Yeah
Er not very early
About quarter to nine twenty to nine
Is that water on there

Did Lorraine come out or stayed in there
Stayed in there and I thought what
She's probably embarrassed as you are

I'm all right with when he's talking to her
But I feel stupid
Cos I went in this morning I'd better on the piss last night
He left his car in the car park see
Well if they do it again you should say come in and have a cup of tea
And I looked in and thought I wonder if that's Clayton in there or not
I'm going to walk in anyway
So I walked in and she went oh morning love
And I went do you want a cup of tea
And she said oh yeah I said tea or coffee
Tea 'll do
Put 's the kettle on
I thought I'd better make a cup of coffee
So I went in and asked her if she wants a smoke
Give her a smoke
She said what's this
I said Wills
Oh I don't that
I'll smoke my own
So at any rate then please yourself
she was smoking like that so I made her a cup of tea took it in and put it on the stool
I said I'm going back now do you want me to leave the kitchen light on
No
All right turn it off
Such a carry on
So what did you do
you can't see in there
You should just say to her
cup of tea
Coming in for a cup of tea
I'd feel so embarrassed
She probably feels as embarrassed as you do Bet
And she always stays in that
I know
She doesn't come out
No
I said to Sally I said I wouldn't be surprised if they two get married
I wouldn't be surprised
big plans to buy Christmas presents shudder
About one hundred of them
Hmm
Second children
Yeah
As you say
So they're second partners and their Mum and Dad
Boy you think
Ten grand kids
You think what my Aunt y Carol 's got to buy for
Now out of the family of family
Oh don't talk to me
included there are about ten
Ann's got a head on ain't she
Why
Her sister I think put her
Was moaning about she had to buy three Christmas presents and she only got two kids So Ann turned round and said oh you're fucking well mad I got to buy five presents and I've only got two kids
And she said not only that whenever my kids babysit for you you only give em a fiver each
Oh she had to buy five presents and she only had two kids
That's right
And Ann said well if you going to fucking be like that don't bother to buy my kids anything
I won't buy your kids anything
Yeah
She says and I will spent that extra couple of quid on my kids
So said if you're going to be like that be like that
So she said don't you fucking worry I am
Yeah
She said bollocks on you lot for Christmas
I ain't buying nothing
Oh she said oh you spent money on the shirts for the kids
That's it you can't these days
The kids come first isn't it
Well they were going with their at the beginning of the year up for register and they're catching up on it now
Oh
That's it
I mean we've got kids and the kids got to come first and the adults come second
like Ann said
It's all right for them because their kids can go on holiday with them so they've got no problems
But because their kids can't go abroad then they get a letter through to say like you know they are going on camp would they be interested
Of course Ann sends off and says yeah
But that's three hundred pounds for them to fit the bill
Oh yeah
Hundred and fifty pound each
That's a fortnight mind
Yeah
And that's everything
That's all their spending money involved and their day trips off the lot
She's got no worries
Her and her old man stays at home and has a fortnight together
Then they go at camping school or whatever wherever the school's going
The kids do that
And then they go on holiday with Ann and the old man
And when they go on holiday with Ann and the old man they used to get through a hundred pounds a day and they go for a week
That's seven hundred pounds like sometimes more
But she said I don't mind because I would like to take my boat but I can't
When we went abroad I know we've spent three or four grand when we're over there with the holiday as well like you know
She said so it's got to be done really she said and I feel so sorry for them she says because even when they get older they still won't be able to go abroad
Yeah
Well I mean I don't see why they
And they've had so many operations
I can't see why they can't go on a camping holiday in France
I mean they can go on the ferry
Take the car out there
They've got their own car
Yeah but they go to somewhere bloody they go to the same place every year and they have a real good time
And she says might just as well be with the kids like so
She ain't really worried
She says the only trouble is when they get older
I mean I am I mean I'm quite surprised that your floor
Whatever floor that Ann's been on hasn't done something like put some money in so that they can take em somewhere else something like over in France or something like that
She wouldn't accept it
She's not that type is she
She'd say don't be silly
Simple isn't she
and they don't want nothing for their kids
She puts them first don't she
Oh yeah
Whatever they want they gets
my darling please
She bought them a telly
I reckon they should have next year a long weekend
Purple
All that money in your pocket haven't you
Let's have a look
There covers
Even if they all go in bed and breakfast and take them two kids to Euro Disney
She er m little T V each
It was T V between them
So many hours and so many nights and
But I would have bought them one each
Yeah
But they're only having one big present each this year
And that's it
That's it
Yeah
Yeah I know
I'd go mad
She said that fucking last year I said
What's the girl
No
Boy thirteen and a girl eleven
Oh
Or twelve that's either two years or a year between them
And don't fight
No
Of course boy and a girl don't
They only argue
They don't fight they only argue but they can't fight cause of their ears
And I think the boy suffers from asthma as well
Well there you are
It's different with a boy and a girl cos
You got your washing out mind you
Because when
You been out there
Her boy went out on this work experience thing for his school like
He must be older than thirteen
He must be fourteen
He must be fourteen hmm
Yeah
Anyway they paid him I told you didn't I
They paid him and the reason they ain't going to have nobody back there any more back to this firm cos safety rules
And er m she was saying that when he was there a bloke come round start giving them a little verbal
She'd never had nothing in his ears to protect his ears
So he's shouting it the boy like
And of course the old man was there and he come over and grabbed the bloke by the throat and he said don't you ever shout at my son like that again
Course he was frightened to death weren't he
And he said well he should know better than to blah blah blah
Hmm
He said my son's fucking deaf you idiot
Well well that is why he don't need to put anything in his ears
Because he can't hear nothing stupid
Well he's still have to put it in his ears
You're going to put your fucking eyes out
Hmm
I bet he got all upset
Well everybody knew when they're up
daft anyway and nine times out of ten you've got to look at him and speak to him and that because he can't understand and er bloke gave him the verbal
He was nearly crying wasn't he
Ah
We didn't know what to say
It's got to be tumble dried
He didn't know he had to give him a little verbal back
It's already
What about the football
my white shirt
You picked Liverpool
Yeah
Put it on then
Turn the tape off
And the day that he left
Is it finished
No it's not finished
It's just that you're going to get that on
Yeah do you know those chocolates you had
How much were they Julie
One pound nine pence some at pence
Was it two pounds sum mat three pounds sum mat
Con t r ast
Con t r ast
I got you a single like a small box
Single didn't you
And they had a double box for three pounds six or something and there are what at Woo lies they're about three fifty six so you're saving fifty P
Oh not a lot
But still
But you're saving something
You save fifty P
I mean if you'd rather get them if you'd rather save fifty P
You'd get them in there wouldn't ya
Well yeah I suppose so
Rather than get them in
Yeah if you want to save yeah yeah
Oh well
I mean if you don't get much of an item off an item you'd know that is well in date
Hmm Hmm
If it's that cheap
It's either that or there's not a lot about
If there's not a lot there then they won't put the price tags down
But if they're got a lot they will
Well I mean well I don't mean you'll sort it out yourself
But there ain't nothing on that pack
Hmm
And luckily enough
I don't bloody know
So when I've been fuss ing about in there
What are they called
Er m
I heard it when I come in didn't I
Yeah
isn't it
It begins with a B.
You can see the packet there orange packet
Yeah I can see it packet
Yeah
Ah
I don't like them
And chocolates all round like
I'd like we had more C ad bury 's in Birmingham once
I'm going back years
I'm going back a bit there
Well they had tea coffee and sandwiches cakes
They had fruit juices for kids
Now I got one lot of fruit juices and I said to go and get some more and there were six empty on the thing then I chuck ed them in and then there were another six empty like
I suppose you can get can you get so many up you can in a lot of places can't you
No I know you used to have a price
But it worked out that they spent twenty thousand pounds on letting families go round for these three weeks
It would be better to
they didn't have the machinery like you got
No it was all hands all done by hand no automation
Yeah yeah
And the villages all round there are pretty out there
Ours ours can't be done automated
That's right
You can't have a computer put the eggs in the pans because it's got to be it's got to be done manually by a worker
Yeah but chocolate 's got so ex pens
My dad's he didn't understand before he seen the mini eggs why they're so dear
There's a lot of work there
It takes thirty two hours before they can be packed
They got to be stored for thirty two hours
It takes so long
So basically all they're saying it takes thirty two hours to do one egg
Yeah
As with Double Decker it can take the most two hours Crunch i e takes the most two hours
As with Crunch i e are there no Crunch i es there now
Yeah
There were Crunch i es yesterday
No no it weren't yesterday
Huh
packs
What packs of Crunch i es

Thursday morning there was packs of Crunch i es
No I don't
I likes a Crunch i e
I don't mind a Crunch i e
It's light isn't it
It doesn't stick in your gob
I likes a Crunch i e
I's eat all the chocolate first and the inside afterwards
More than that now though
Oh aye
Yeah but you can buy it
You could buy it in a penny packet bloody great
I used to get a lot of it when I was in
And it used to be dark brown
It used to be darker than bloody
They made it different then didn't they
Mm
It's bloody mass produced now isn't it
So before my work out this morning I said to Joe he's in the bathroom
Done Joe's bedroom and er the Hoover was up there the dusters was up there so I thought shall I shall I
No I've got dinner before one and I thought well
Well
properly
with Crunch i e right
They set on a big conveyor belt
There's got to be about eight foot wide and er
I'd seen that being done on the telly the other night
A hundred and fifty degrees C that's what it comes out at
Right and it goes like these great fun nels spread it Now as it goes down it gets caught down
And when it gets cut
It's got cut like boiling hot oil a laser of oil
Oh oh
And we got told now I didn't know this
We got told that that laser of oil can cut through concrete just like that
Just as quick as it goes through a Crunch i e
Bloody hell
So they have so much problems with it like they'll never ever experiment with that again
They'll keep it for Crunch i e but never use it for anything else again because they've had so much trouble with it

Silly sod

We had them changed once cos there was so many damn
Gate Gate Bathrooms we are

You don't wanna go up As da
No thanks I've got to cook me dinner
I don't like As da now
No I hate it now
I bloody hate it
We went up Friday
Now the bloody have you ever
Think we'll have a suggestion box
They had a kids party a game
Where the smokers ' end is
Yeah
Now why do they have kids parties where there's smokers smoking with children
Yeah but I wouldn't want a kids party round there with all that ooh bloody going on
Ooh it was terrible
The music was so loud
I don't like
Why don't they have it right down there at that end where there's no smoking and the little children would be right out of the way
Well yeah
They've got a room there haven't they they can have
But there's the bloody place and on a Friday night I thought ooh bloody
shop Sunday
No
I ain't shopping on a Sunday
But you don't need shopping on a Sunday do you
Well I wouldn't go to the shop on Sunday anyway
I just don't
No I never
like shopping on Sundays
Nothing religious about it
No but it's
Bu I it's a shame that I
Six days shalt thou labour
The sh the shops that are shut on a Sunday and it's a day
I think it's the lord's day and I'm not
Well it's a day of rest
Yes it's a day of rest
Not shopping
I I just don't
I'd rather come and borrow
Say Bet I've gotta have some sugar
And I don't never do that cos I don't like doing it
But I would
Rather than go round the shops
Well yeah
I can't see no sense in it
No
I wouldn't go shopping on a Sunday
N that is not on religious grounds either that is because I just think that they work six days they should have a day off anyway
That's bloody greed half of it
Oh unions split Sundays off
I think you can only spend your money once
Course you can
So if they're gonna go up there on a Sunday they ain't gonna go up there on another day
You can only
Well
spend your money once and that's it
So if you go Sundays you ain't gonna go Mondays or Tuesdays
No
That's right
Yeah but it's a flash in the pan
It'll suddenly die down
They'll say well it ain't worth opening we
We ain't taking enough
They're only gonna open four weeks before Christmas aren't they

Oh Dave my journey running about early in the morning to leave everything tidy for the chaps came out without anything inside their tum provided that I could have coffee on the in the buffet car on the train from Stow Market no hot drinks madam we haven't got enough power in the batteries I thought well you know it's all we got to Liverpool Street on time
These are brilliant
from Liverpool Street I wanted to get to Oxford Circus which meant that I had to change at I forget where now because I'm in such a a muddle now after all this
where ever it was whatever it was I had to do I got stuck there were there were just no underground trains in either direction on that line at all and a a great tan ner went
dad
and I looked at people we were all saying why we waiting here why we waiting and we saw people rushing off so we thought we've got to rush off after them and we were all put on the train and sent to Cha ring Cross which wasn't where most of us wanted to go or anything like we wanted to go
and from Cha ring Cross
Those pretty good
I worked my way over

on an underground train which couldn't decide if it's going to move or not it did eventually move I got a taxi at one point and I was so sick and tired and they put me outside Liberties I gave the man a twenty pound note and he gave me change for a ten yes coming back from Oxford Circus from Liberty's I thought I'd better ec on om ise I've been done out of ten pounds I don't think it was dishonesty I think it was just sheer muddle I I'm ten pounds down I'm must cut down a bit so I will come back underground from Oxford Circus to Waterloo to get down to and you've guessed it I got into an an underground train which would not move it simply stuck and it would go c hugg ac hugg ac hugg ac hugg ac hugg a then it would stop in the tunnel for a while while its

Won't talk to us in English
Which is
That's very good yes
Ourour last teacher does but she's not very good
That's how I was taught you see and so in spite of the long lapse of years there's still a tremendous amount up there because it was it was properly learnt you learn something thoroughly
Cos Lee since this one's been talking to him all the time
Mm
she won't have English
No
and I I went to see her in open evening I couldn't understand her cos she you know she real I mean she is French
Yes and he English is not very good

It's nice though that
Oh it is I shall love it
It's nice yeah
In the next house you see I shall have to have different seating they they I'm going to I'm going to get somewhere smaller so that three piece suite it owes me nothing it only cost me what seven hundred pounds
You've had it quite a long time haven't you
and it's been and it's been beaten to hell
That's right
Er m I'll probably have er two or perhaps a three seat er sofa and for the rest fire side chairs
Mm
And er I thought I'd probably have wall paper on that wall you know use use the curtains just as plenty of full ness but have them for keeping out the light or keeping in the heat
Mm
not make them an enormous feature
Mm
The grey I mean if if they
They're lovely
It's the wrong that's the the wrong pink
It's a sort of salmon rather than the pink
Mm that's the only thing I don't like
Mm
But they they so so you can I mean I haven't phoned up yetbut they you can just have the the slate s replaced you keep all your fittings
Yes
and all your all your weights and everything at the bottom and you just can have them replaced if you want

and run them up the strips
Yes
You know make it sort of to match
Perhaps line your strips with lining to give them body
To give them yeah yeah don't talk into it it just just chat away they'rethey're not interested in what you're talking about it's just they're interested in er m on what's what you know what's what's er m
Who's got a
Sorry
A tank
A tank
What sort of tank
Not a tank a bowl a glass one no not a glass one plastic supposed to be quite
How long is
Well what's it for
No it's got to be right right er big and I'm going to stuff it with a plank of wood and put I've got about two bushes and what the problem is is you've got get
I don't see any way your school's got to make this
we have you've got to make a model yeah and that's mine you have to get two men and two children across the river you've got one and they can't swim this is my one two boys go across one boy comes back one man goes across the other boy comes back two boys go across one boy comes back one man goes across the other boy comes back two boys go across I need to show that on on
You've gotta do what
You've got to
I need two men
You can draw it can't you
You gotta do it
No cos I got to show it and I can't
Oh I see but you you don't need anything big you need small things surely
You want something like a little er m like a moose you know a moose carton
Mm
How you gonna fit a little baby canoe to go across and two
Well where you gonna get a baby canoe from any way
I can make one
You could ma you could you could get something like or er m a pudding bowl then you could make a little baby canoe out of tin foil
Mmmm
and the men out of tin foil
Oh yeah
Or pipe cleaners
Or pipe cleaners
Pipe cleaners are very good for that
Can pick some pipe cleaners up they're good for making little
Why don't you just put a rope across it there then walk across the rope
Cos haven't got nothing except canoe

I can yes I can remember having this sort of question about people with jugs and they wanted to measure out a certain amount but they haven't got any markings for this certain amount and that awful
This stupid Lee at the moment for his exam he's meant to have done it by Christmas and he hasn't done it for C D T and he they had to just choose something er m to make that actually sort of works so Lee couldn't I mean they did crane's and things like that and he couldn't the thing he came up with and he's teacher was a a go er mwhat was it Dave a go a lie stand in his goal
I got
and he had like a shooter thing that would ere rm a bolt or something would shoot the balls out

Mmmm
er m to give the go a lie sort of practice yeah
practice yes
but he's still got to come up he's got to make this thing I mean it's gonna be enormous with football's
I can remember at West field school about fifteen years ago we had an art teacher who got the children to make an enormous thing I think it was a Loch Ness Monster and it went out of out of the door of one room into another you know and they spent days and ages on making this thing
Mm
and I thought at the time it's it's quite good enough just to have the idea and talk about the idea make some drawings and
Mm
you know
Well this

But I said to Lee you know
Open
have a chat with you cos there might be something that you think that it could make that sort of like not such a big sort of model

Mm
If I cut some wood crosses
Well if you start cutting wood you want to do things that are simple
You've got your upstairs in the bathroom why don't you use that
Oh no I wanna do something to go across there get a piece of string get some string yeah make a plasticine canoe yeah and then put join two pieces of string to it
interesting
and then not if you can't get held up by a piece of string would it
Well why not use your own penny boat
Yeah you can use put your people in it all people
Cos they look like real people
yeahthat's better
yes
all you know that's now you're learning Frenchone of the things that the French say they're always saying it is make things easy go the straightest way towards any thing
You can go and make you pick out you're like Lee you pick out these hardest things
Yeah yo like you say y I love the kids dearly I said to Dave I bet that's why this I weekend and he
Yeah yeah
He said too it'll do you good sort of time so I look don't you think ooh
Don't you think I look a bit
hag ga rd and my eyes and
Yeah
I'm starting to put on a bit of weight
Oh good
Which is good cos it was just
Yes
just over er m er just over a stone I've lost
Yes
And you know it sort of
Mm
frightened me
Mm
cos of this
Yes you can't afford to lose it
That's right and I mean you know it's like now my hair needs cutting and you know
you just feel I think when you've sort of lost much weight
Mm
and I mean you know and I always feel the bloom ing cold
I mean I feel
Oh yes
the cold anyway but sort of
Yes
I said to Dave you could feel my hip bones and it oh
Ah
it was awful
I dunno
Yes
you know I always said wouldn't it be lovely to be thin and I said thank God
No
for a bit of fat on you
Oh absolutely
I said because
Well I remember Jackie telling me she came back from sh she came up to meet me in London one day and she came up with the woman a German woman who at that time was a buyer for Army and Navy er women's fashions and this woman said that the model girls who are so thin she said they're always bursting into tears and crying because they're under such stress to keep their weight down and their boyfriends don't like it because the girls are are lovely to have on their arms to take out you know everybody sort of goggles you know lovely slim girl with yellow half way down her back etc. but in fact these girls get very very ratty
Mm have you seen Jackie lately
She phoned me a couple of days ago and said you know that life was really quite on top of them her mother - i n - l a w died and they've had all the problems of putting the old man into a home the main problem
being of course is first of all find your home and while he wasn't in a home he was driving the neighbours mad because he's beginning to get confused and wander about and maintain that he hasn't had his dinner when two people have already taken him in lunch you know and the other problem is er m er er having found him a very nice home he didn't want to go
He didn't want to go
No not likely
He wanted to stay in his own place but Jackie and Ne ville were nearly driven mad running up and down to Le tch worth when all that they had to do Jackie's full time teaching and Nev is trying to build as many kitchen s or build as many doors for millionaires as he possibly can
So how's er m young Neil
Neil poor boy he had a driving lesson yesterday came home and said I don't want to do any more
What driving
Mm so he was going to go up to
I bet
Neil bring cup of tea in here and we'll talk about it and I didn't really want to spare the time because you could imagine that I wanted to get ready to come away but I I made myself sit and really give him time
Mm
and he said he lack she totally lacks confidence
This is what he said
Yep and and he doesn't seem to be able to concentrate and I said but Neil you can drive when you go out with me you drive beautifully yes but yours is an automatic car I said it's not that I said you've got road sense you know what you're doing I said your good
No I'm not I'm awful
I said look Neil you can drive but let's not let's not take it that I'm saying that you must drive let's go into the question of why you're making a mess of it at this time and we oh honestly Brenda if I've got black circles under my eyes do not be surprised because of course this all goes back to his absolutely appalling ly stupid mother
He's really on a downer isn't he
He i she said my mother said she could have been a forensic scientist if it ha if I hadn't been born
Well Brenda you can tell I hit the roof
I mean normally I never criticize the woman because after
No
all mothers are sacred but I just had to put the boot in on her I'm afraid I said stuff
I said she could have taken a degree in her spare time in th she's only she's not yet forty I said that's absolute rubbish I said th the world is full of these damn women going around saying if only I hadn't had children I could have been Lord Chief Justice of England I said it isn't true
I said an er I said do you think that I wasn't a career woman I said I gave it all up for yo er to have to look after my young babies and then when the babies were no longer young when I got through that phase of my life I went back and combined looking after a home very adequately thank you
With quite a difficult job I said this is a I said your mother is living in a fantasy world of course I see the stupid bitch prancing around Stow market with her silly nose in the air
She's a very conceited woman Pete the adult er o us told me she was a very conceited woman and er Neil says I I I'd have to talk to him to him about this she couldn't discuss anything with him she would lay down the law that was how it had to be and I said no I said Gerry and I I had no hesitation as I said in putting the boot in and Brenda and Dave take the same the attitude to children that you let them first of all when they're small you have to tell them no like you do not
That's right
put your handy in the fire dear
Mm
And then when they get bigger you give them more and more freedom to do just what they want to do and all you do is watch carefully and make sure they're not doing anything obviously outrageously daft but you let them find themselves and if there are problems they bring their problems to you and you sit down and you quietly talk about it there's not shouting no I say you've got to do this because I am your parent
That's obviously her that was her answer
that's her answer yes
You just sort of wa you know argue it an
I know
and and he says too he had to admit that he's lazy
Who Neil
Neil yeah and he said my mother is a lazy cow
Yeah but don't you think he he he finds I mean if alright y y you're not ex always exactly like your parents but if you've bro if he's brought up his mother's lazy
Yeah
so I mean you know that's part of his life isn't it
Yes
I mean it's he won't know better
This is what I said to him this is what I said to him an but he said I I see you with all your get up and go so I didn't make any reply to that
No
I thought well let it sink in
That's right
And I came in one day a few days ago an and running around like a bee on heat with er m cries of oh I've got so much to do and no time left in which to do it and I went ha I said yesif you got up early you know
That's right he cos he is very bad on timing isn't he
Shocking
I mean like you say you ought you know you ought to buy her a talking alarm clock for Christmas
Oh yes he's got to have an alarm clock
Or a radio one
Yes
so tha that would actually
Yes
the noise
Of course I've I've left him in the charge of of not I haven't asked Paul to take him under his wing over the weekend but I've left Neil a list of things that I would like done
Mm
Like get back the dust b ins which took them out but she didn't bring them back at the end of the drive er m and I hope that Paul tells him off
And make him do it do it
An and you know says look Neil you've got to get your ideas together because that's what Neil has lacked he's lacked masculine influence
Mm
It's no good
now I mean you've been very to Neil over the last year or so and I mean now it's time to get his act together
Oh yes
She can't keep on
No
I mean
I mean I've stopped I've I I don't any longer get up and get anybody's breakfast for them
Nope but if you get you know
I get out I get out of bed at eight o' clock when the last of the lodge r s has gone well the last of the two lodge r s
Mm but you can't
gone
you know y y there's no more now I mean running around
er of being unemployed the th i Neil is the third lodge r of course tha who get's out of the pit at about eleven o' clock in the morning
Mm
But er that's from now on Neil has got to carry th the responsibility for his own actions
That's right
I'm not going to bail him out by jumping into the car
And really he's got to I mean you know alright with work wise I mean he's got to take even if I mean the kids these days I mean even at Neil's age I mean you know I've come the conclusion now these kids they think the world owes them something
Yes they do
They're not like in our day
I know no
I mean they really think I mean it's like Lee he's doing this work experience an yes it's great an it's a bit boring mum and Dave said Lee you know wake up
Yes
This is reality
Yes
This is what people go to work in an office
Quite
work nine to five thirty
Yes yes
He said we I tell you what I didn't like mum an I said what
He said making the tea I said tough
Yes exactly
I said what do you think you go
Yeah
into your I said you go into a job your earning
Mm
twenty five grand a year an and you're sat at that desk and you're boss
I said it doesn't it work like that Lee
No
I said you're the general dogs body
Quite quite
He said oh God
And I said we
That's the way life goes
you know I said that is life
Yeah mm
He said God he said I didn't realize it's like that I said no you didn't
Do you do you think they get a false idea from the television or something wha what is it
Well I dunno I th i I think the teachers to be honest Jean no you
Ah
know th the teachers in this I mean you know I don't know I mean so some of the teachers have got got really weird ideas
Have they
I mean you know it it's unbelievable
But
Ooh I'd like to know what their weird ideas are
Well it's just er m ah I don't know I mean there's there's certain things I mean it it's like this maths I mean I I spoke to her er m and she said yes Lee had come on and everything in his maths and I said we the thing is I said knowing Lee has difficulty in in th l in the high level maths yes you don't want to drop him but surely I said I'm willing to help in my spare time Lee's willing to do it and I said can't you show Lee I said I'm not I wasn't trying to tell her
No
you know that what you were told
Nonono no no
and I think
Yes well I think I told him a wrong you see there were two there there are two ways of tackling it and I don't think the way I told him is what they want for the examination purposes at all
Oh I don't know he under when you that told he understood it a lot more than when she said it and she sort of went all
She's probably trying to explain them in a very complicated way of doing maths
No she answered me she said well I haven't got time to sit down explain it to them they just gotta if they're in a high level they should be able to grasp it and I
Frankly I think that's very bad
that's no attitude
you know that is no attitude
That's bad
You know the fact is they've got to er m be explained
Yes
Er m I mean Carla I can't fault her teachers
No no
at that church one she has learnt so much er m I mean this to speak French now she speaking it in three weeks
She's excellent isn't she yes
You know it's un be lie v
Three weeks
three weeks that's all she's been doing it
That's marvellous
You know I mean but this teacher won't stand no nonsense and I said to Lee y you were at it three years before you could speak like Carla speaks it
You know she has learnt so much
Er m i in this school I mean
Yes
they're very strict I mean
Yes
you know but I think half of Lee's it there's no discipline
No ha
but then
and when you try t in the past when I tried to find some way of imposing discipline there is no way because quite rightly you're not allowed to strike children I never wanted to and I I hardly ever did at one school where there was a marvellous spirit of give and take I used to whip off my little black velvet slip per occasionally and whack some of the larger boys about the top of the thigh
just for fun you know but I'm not a believer in using your fists you ought to be using your brain to teach with but there were no there are no sanction s if you say you must stay behind after school you have to send a letter home and half the parents will write back and say my son or daughter is not staying after school and that is that
Mm
And that's their right and so you think of something else we you're not allowed to take them out of a favourite lesson you're not allowed to say you are going to miss your football or a P E P E teachers and the football teachers quite rightly say if you can't keep discipline in your class why why should we be penal i zed
Mm that's right
And er you're pretty helpless really
You are
You see the only way that you can really discipline them is when you have a school where the rules have been very very strict from the moment that they went into that school and they have had their noses held to the grind stone with work up to their brow s and they just don't think of being tiresome and anybody who is tiresome is pulled out and put in a special room on their own called a sin bin an which is rather boring and made to work even harder
Mm but no what I'm sort of getting back I mean you know I don't I think it's the kids I mean I dunno why
Whether they have too much or what they have but I mean they're just they just think everybody owes them something and it's like Neil I mean to me I mean I can't see why he can't get off his backside and go and work in a super market but it's not the job they want the same answer I said to
I think at the moment Brenda he would take any job if he could get one
He would take if offered it
Yes I think so I
There's a lot of I mean it's like
To be fair to be fair to him I think that he would er m he's set his heart on going and working at the lawn mower place on the production line
Mm
and he isn't in my opinion really considering half the other jobs but he has said that he wants that and by the mercy of providence this business of Lee being flung out by Andy and being put back on to the into the job centre coincides with my being very tight on money
Mm
You'll notice that I've said to you we're going to run the
That's right yeah
And I'm going to pay it back with lodge r s money really
Mm
I mean my dear I said to Paul Paul yesterday was was babbling on about if Karen would take him back and I said Paul I shall be extremely displeased if you ever leave this house to go back to Karen you know o after only being with me for something like three or four weeks I said you'll never come back again I said I'm not going to be messed about like that
No that's right
What did he say to that
Oh I'm counting on you lodge r s money
That's right
And I am Brenda
Yeahbut thing is I mean you know there's a lot of kids out there I mean I've know with sort of Lee's friend you know okay with us I mean with Lee o okay we don't I've often said to him why don't you get a Saturday job
And he said no and I said okay fair enough but then you know you can say to Lee well if you want something now you're gonna have to work
Yes
and then he will he'll go and do something
Yes mm let's go here I won't talk
Er m
Er m
but thing is there's a lot lot of like Lee's friends and that and they say well I couldn't work in a shoe shop and I wouldn't work in a and I say why
Quite
Well they say well would you do jobs you don't like
Yes if I need the money
The the only job which I told Neil I do not expect him to take is working for waste disposal because he did that this time last year and before he started he was full of big talk about you make a lot of money and you get a lot of tips at Christmas he found that you do not make a lot of money and you do not get generous tips at Christmas
Mm
and he used to come home looking as white as a sheet sick to the teeth and he used to just go to bed and collapse in a heap he isn't strong enough to do it and it's pointless for him to try but other than that he can do anything he fancies
Mm
I vi r I just got
Neil I mean he
No but I mean he has had a bad start
and hasn't had the example of either a mother or a father who understands the necessity of
But there are a lot of
work
that have had the support but they won't get off their back sides and it tends to be this ge generation
Well you know when my son was eighteen he and his friends were entertaining each other to pocket parties at which they were working out what University courses they were going to apply for
Mm
and what they wanted was the easiest ones and they came up with the answer economic s Gerald simply we Ge Gerry and I put our heads together and went bib bib bib bib bib you know as good parents do and we both presented him with a fait accompli you either take an engineering degree we don't care what sort or you go out to work in a bank because economic s you will not get a first because you are not reader and t to get a first in economic s which is what you'll need if you're gonna make any money out of it
Mm
and have a decent life to get a first or either a two one in economic s you have got to read a very great deal you've got to be a reader a student a taker of notes a writer of essays and we said that is not you so within two
Mm
minutes he was looking through all the advertisement s for civil engineering
That's right but you had the encourage ment who's that waving
Who where
That car in front I dunno he was waving I just hope it wasn't waving at us
That one E E
I dunno
The Fi esta
Maybe she wasn't waving at us
No
it was only for a minute
Oh
Nonono she's not
Yeah
I think she's realized she's made a mistake she was waving away
Oh yes yes yes
And thought it was somebody else
Yes
But er no I mean there's th there's
that they've just you know I mean some of the kids I don't know where we were going me and Dave somewhere or other we were and there was some kids an and their attitude you know it's well why should we do this you know
Mm
this isn't fair I mean life's not fair
I think it's the television as much as anything else
Yeah probably yeah tha that does
I mean I'm appalled at the way that teenagers are still being shown on the television as they were twenty years ago able to rule the roost because they did
Mm
They did er m twenty years ago a teenager a girl of sixteen could leave home she could pick up a job just like that
Mm
And you know get reasonable money and there were there were still rented rooms of a sort but she could find somewhere of a sort to live with other kids and they could do what they jolly well liked
I dunno it's I mean you know it's
But those days are well and truly over
And I don't think they'll ever come back
For one thing I I don't think that the next generation of parents are going to stand it because with the cos I told you what what I said Neil about er m when er when he was a father I said if you had a pretty fifteen year old daughter would you want to have some rough oaf taking her down a back alley and screwing her
No I bloody wouldn't he said cor that's awful and it it's just what he's been doing
Doing that's it it's alright for him to do it
okay for him but nobody's going to touch his little girl
Ah but er m
Or my own boy
no I mean I I do really feel sorry Neil because people wa it it it makes me cross because people won't give Neil the benefit of the doubt
No they won't they won't
You know and if they just won't give him a chance
No they won't
And I mean the fact you know y you can see his point I mean
Yeah
Harry hasn't given up totally I mean he hasn't
No he would've done if you hadn't but he says this
I mean he feels like it obviously like with
Oh yes
his driving
Yes
What's the point
I've got
Yep
no confidence who cares you know whether I pass or that I mean
Well I did we we talked about this you see Mary Anne half way through the conversation er Neil went out of the room so that I could to Mary Ann and I said towards the end of my conversation you know Mary Ann you're a very wise person give me some advice I said I told her about Neil not wanting no not doing well on the driving although he can drive she said he doesn't want to do it she said don't hassle him so when he came downstairs I said I've been talking to Mary Ann and she sends you her love and because of course you know we've got a grandson you know she had a son my
That's right yeah
grandson is about that age and very sympathetic she is er m I said er Mary Ann says she doesn't know what the point is you don't really want to do it he said she's right I don't he said in a way I do in another way I don't I said
You see
well we can't go into the reasons for that but I said let's respect the reasons I said if that's how you feel I said you're a man you you must make your own decisions I said probably in a few months time you'll come
Well I don't know why I was drawn to that colour
It's that's my colour isn't it
Yes
In your got my fork instead of a spoon didn't I
Oh Ooh
So it it's Paul has the other lodge r gone yet
Philip
Yeah
No he's going pretty soon I think
He's a pain though is he
Mm I went into his room and yet again he has got wet washing hanging up inside that room
What in his bedroom
Mm
How does he put it out then
Where did you buy that top you've got on
British Home Stores
It's lovely
Mm
Is that the one when you were with me
Mm
Looks really nice on
Mm
So have you seen this chap any more
Mark
This new man is his name Mark
Little o little old one er m when did I see him
Sunday
Sunday
We went over to Lave nha m
Where did you meet him at
Marriage agency
What Date line
No Destiny a local one
Oh you're not with Date line any more
No no good
Not for me this local one is absolutely splendid
Is it
Mm You ca
What about
You can talk to the man who's running it
Is Ron still going with his
Oh yes he's still with Trudy
Do you reckon he'll end up getting married
No
No what on her side or his
Her side she won't have it
Won't she
No I've warned Ron he's such an ob s tin ate so and so he won't be told
I said that I think you'll find Ron that Trudy if she married would have to give up her late husband's occupational widow's pension so that the way you're going on now where you go and stay with her for two or three days at a time is far better oh nonono she'll be able to keep her pension I said I very much doubt it then I said people are so jealous that if she does marry you and he doesn't tell the firm I bet that one of her dear neighbours will oh no they're all very nice people round where she lives I thought there's no good arguing with Ron
Would she lose he pension then if she got married
Well mostly yes
Careful when you put your cup
If you haven't if you worked if you haven't worked at th sorry
Careful when you pick that up it's ever so slippery
Oh my God
If you get a a pension based on the fact that you're your late husband's widow when you are no longer your late husband's widow but somebody's wife they don't have to pay you that pension
Oh so I suppose Trudy doesn't know either
No
Actually I can't blame her
No and she doesn't want Ron to move into her house because there is no way that he could
The thing is he's so isn't he
Yes
It doesn't sort of change anything Has he organized his
Sorry
Will he organize his
No not really no it's still a great big mudd ly tip
You have seen it haven't you
No
Oh oh you must
Cos how old is he
Seventy
He's quite good for seventy in he
Oh very oh yes
The thing is now you see there's no way would you change him
No
But he wouldn't want it would he
No
This is lovely
Mm
I mean poor old Ron
He's been going with her quite a while though has he
Yes oh yes
So she's just happy with that relationship is she
Yes in fact to be perfectly honest with you the relationship is a bit more than she wants Ron is a bit of a pain I told him over and over again not to push his luck I said for goodness sake Ron be grateful for what you've got apparently she doesn't like to make love with the lights on I said well if that's what she doesn't like that's what she doesn't like you're not going to change a woman of sixty eight
Oh the way she and her husband went on that's all in the past I said yesbut it's there was an awful lot of it
That's right he should really especially tha at her age
Mm
He should sort of honour her wishes shouldn't he
He should
So has he all gone to his g r mother's at Christmas
Mm yes I told Paul that he can bring a lady up at Christmas - t i m e
Is he not going home then
No and er m I'm leaving a turkey in the freezer an Paul is quite good at cooking standard cooking
Yeah he'll he'll I remember he cooks for himself doesn't he an
Mmmm
He I mean I know he eats you out of house and home but he's quite a good lodge r isn't he
He's a very good lodge r
Mm
yes last week he helped me turn the garage out he took all the rubbish left over from the tip down to the tip
So did Nev come and do your kitchen
Well almost I got the cupboard done and I got the til es lying by the side of the hob but they haven't yet been cut to fit er m and glued down but one of these day's he'll get around to it
He's doing a lot in his house
Mm well Jackie rang me Thursday evening and said you know then my life is get up early let the dogs out or whatever stagger into school stagger back do a meal do some marking fall into bed
That's a lot
That's her life
Where's she going Christmas
She's going home I think she's not having Ben it a and her mother up
Are they
They still can't do it
What will Paul just go and visit his mo Neil go and visit mum and then come back cos although Paul's there
Mm
it's better isn't
Mm
it
Yes that's right
Are you gonna have a tree up
Yes didn't buy any new or nam ents when I was up in Liverpool cos I didn't see anything that I particularly liked but what Carla has done gives me an idea for making some extra bits for the tree Where did you get that from
Bernard Singer s the what the net ting
Mm
Yeah that's all it is all it is is like
Mm
like net ting
Cha r la tan it's called
Oh that's what it's called
Mm
Mm ninety nine pence a meter
Mm
Er m Singer s do every colour it's just the fact she wanted to give friends a present and I said
Mm mm
you know it it you can't afford to to
No
do it
No
and I said to her one night and we bought those bags of sweets it was ninety nine pee for about forty
Mm
and I said just put two or three in each
Mm
that's enough for
Mm
a child
Mm yeah
and she had great fun we
Mm
did them in an evening
Mmmm
And I didn't use ribbon cos it would have worked expensive for her I just used that er m
I saw
curly stuff
the
for her
Yeah mm
But for kids I mean
Mm
they're only gonna throw
Yeah
it away aren't they
Mm oh yes
And it'll be a you know a waste ribbon so I
Mm
thought I'll just put that on it
Mm
And she thinks they're wonderful
Mm they are
Well
I was just thinking what a dozen would look like hanging on my tree
Yeah they're so simple
Mm
I mean all I use I mean if I was making them for somebody I would use about four or five layers and then I would put a piece of lace of bra id or something at the top
mm
just to make if I was making them really
Mm mm
but for the tree I thought well I'm gonna make some I'm gonna make six like the colour ing we did er m the er m wa black red and white
Yeah
on the top and then in er m go to three circles and then all different colour you know er m
What another skirt
That's right yeah It's really hot isn't it
Mm
Er m but you see these si I mean Debs do it as well all that that net ting
Yeah
mm
But I think I would do four and the green's quite nice they do cos I've got a white Christmas you see
Mm
so I've gotta think what colour
Mm
Have you still got your artificial or did you have new real
I'm going to buy an artificial this year I'm sick of the real ones
But I mean I bought my artificial my white one ten years ago now
Mm
I remember when I bought it it was about twenty five quid
Mm
which was a lot of money
Mm
then
Yes
But it owes me nothing now
That's right
I think if you get a decent one
Mm
it lasts a long time dunn it
Yes they do
But I I couldn't get over you know I say I had a quick look the other at Marks you know to even do the Christmas ser viet tes they're doing a lot more and they said if people aren't buying as much on the clothes side er m so they they've come down I mean now I can get er m come over and I said you've never looked at Marks I said you never buy clothes I said have a look in Marks I said they do some really lovely
Lovely clothes
and he saw two sweaters in there that he really liked
Mm
and they were nineteen ninety nine
Ah
It's a good thing too
Mm
cos I would always thought Marks were that it was one day
M hm
you know
Yes
And usually
I know
but er m filling inn it
Mm very
Look at that little boy there in the leather coat and the little glasses I think it looks lovely
Ah yes
Mm
It's ideal though isn't it when y I suppose you go and do your shopping an somewhere to stop
Yes Well I'm just going to have a little nibble at the end of that
So what about er m so where are you going to Johns ' or Mary Ann s ' for the holiday

Mm Are they in the up your way
No
No
No
Re an article in the paper about and it was saying the mar in Marble Arch that it it's got the top rating apparently
No not surprising
It said Marble Arch was good er m but because you can't park here it gave a that you could do like three or four loads load your car up come back load your car up
Mm
where in Marble Arch nine times out of ten you've gotta get round the back to pick it up
Yep yep and who
and so
bothers
That's it
I certainly couldn't can't drive that well
Oh it was really those are flap jacks
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
And that's jolly good isn't it
Mm try it in a minute not greasy at all that flap jack
No mm
It's nice
Lovely
So when are you seeing this chap again then
Well he phoned me last night and he's going to phone me again on Sunday afternoon we get on so well Brenda I can just the imagine the pair of us tucked up into a four foot bed
Whether any good would come of it is another matter
Is he what's he looking for is he does he wanna relationship or does he want
We haven't even talked about that we just talk and talk about anything and everything
Is he divorced or widow ed
Widower
Widower
Mm divorced men of fifty five and upwards are bad news
How old's this guy then
Seventy five
And he's he's a little old man and I think he's smashing
How long ago did he lose his wife then
Er m a year
Does he talk about her still
M hm
A lot
Mm quite naturally you know doesn't worry me
But he's not comparing
No I don't think so
Cos some of these are sort of like they go on and on and there sort of
Oh my dear some of them are comparing you with R ac quel Welsh or whatever you know you get the impression they're looking down their nose as much to say oh how dreadful for me to have to be seen with this old person
But he he's nice
Mm he really i she's kind
Where do you go out
and he's not mean so many of these old men are mean they're crafty and cautious and mean
He took me out last Sunday and I said as we were driving over to Lave nha mI said an early would be much appreciated I said I cooked the Sunday Lunch for my lodge r s but I haven't in fact had any myself he said you've got to have a high tea he said you must have a proper meal and he ordered up salad and a a ham salad and have this and have that and have the other where as some of them like this chap Gerald who was er m sent me by one of the other agencies the first time we went out he took me to a meal and he obviously felt that quite enough after that he used to come out to see me after he'd had his meal meanness hanging on to money
Wasn't going to waste money on a woman of around his own age
Tes c o's as you see it's got the er er the go ahead to er open Sunday's hasn't it
Yes yes
Now is a big thing
Mm
We co we were horrified with er m we got thing through the door like er m this one was like a survey thing saying they wanted to you know er the cricket amongst others they wanna put a Tes c o's super store there
Oh no
And anyway it's in the paper in the paper this week and they've been saying that er the outrage the residents
Yeah yeah
I mean like Dave said I mean alright we could perhaps do with a super store but not the
Not there no no no
I mean that's a bit daft really
You know who it is that wants to make money on that
That's that dreadful man
Councillor he's had his greedy little eyes on that are a for years
Has he
Mm
Yes because I know do you remember we were gonna buy a house down there
Mm
Mm
but then when we went into it they said er m obviously look at the development plans and it would go ahead eventually for something there they didn't state what
No
I mean it might be whatever year
Well I went to a a big meeting round about nineteen eighty five
Yeah I remember you said
and they he wanted to where Marge lived remember The Grove
Mm
They wanted to
That whole bit
raise that and have that developed as a road the other one would be closed
Yeah
and developed would be destroyed and another an an another big road put in it's place and he they they were after Horse ll Mo or which is where they're going to put the Tes c o's
Mm
That area's called Horse ll Mo or
I don't think they made it
I bet
though do you
Well I hope not
We do need one
Yes we do we do need another store in Wo king of that kind
But they're are not
Not there
how long has Anthony been there twenty
Ah
thirty years
Thirty years easily I mean it wa it was already established when we arrived in nineteen fifty nine
But Dave said Tes c o's can't do what they did they did it at We y bridge they said let us buy your sight you say where you wanna sight and then they and we will build what you
Mm
want on that sight
Mm
for you
Mmmm yes
But as John still got a lot of work on and Mary Ann
Yes
Is it getting
No but Mary Ann's a
public servant and they're pretty well pro t protected er m John's firm is simply doing extremely well in spite of the recession
Yes right
I mean they're very pleased with him because he's the front man having appeared on the Anne ka Rice thing and being kissed by Anne ka Rice in the full view of millions I mean John can do no wrong by r by John a than I doubt it
Did he manage to see get it did he video it
Yes Mary Ann's done it
Oh Mary Ann did it he'll be able to see it
Mm
What did he think of Anne ka Rice
Oh you know she is what she is what she'll be
Is that's right
Vital lively attractive
Yes
Yeah
Did you see you with that gas that ad ver t she did with that poor woman
Yes
Yes
I don't blame the woman for doing as much as possible on television with in those advertisement s because I think that woman have got only a short life in those ads because she'd get bored with them
Wonder why
Well she she's she gets up and does things doesn't she
Yeah that's what I mean they say ooh can't stand this woman sh but I mean I don't know why
Jealousy I think
Probably
Hell of a lot of
I mean
jealousy
she's got a lot of get and go
That she has she has
this is taping now so what was er m Liberty s did they have it
Re remind me tomorrow I must take those twenty voucher s
Mm
to er m Debs
Mm
and Jenny was saying she went to De ben hams yesterday they had a twelve day spectacular at eight thirty to eight thirty at night there was clothes they were half price plus you got a third of ten per cent off
Yes
But I think a all the sales will be off before Christmas
I I looked at the fabric s in the Liberty s
Yeah
and if I can't get want I want at the F am ling ham Textile Centre which is excellent when I next need fabric s I shall come up I will come up to London and I'll go to Liberty s but I will have measured first of all to within an inch as to what I want because
It is expensive
Well some of the stuff is eighteen pounds a meter but if you think of the cost of a a well fitting jacket for somebody like myself it's astro nom ical
You know what you should have done while you was up there this time you should have took asked for some samples
Yes my dear I I did not feel well enough just
No do you think that they will
I didn't even think about yes they will they'll give you a little cutting I suppose
Yeahbut not only that I mean they will now all these shops are doing like a mail order
That's interesting
and they would actually send and I know why because er m John Lewis in London er m Jackie wanted some fabric and she'd seen it up there and Har rods and er m she found out she didn't have her card with her just her Barclay card said would you post this we wou we'll have to charge you like two pound
Mmmm
fifty packaging but that's fine she said
Well yes it's very good
well I couldn't get up there because she know
Quite
park
Quite
and she wanted sort of so many meters of each
Mm yeah
and the the they sent it to her
Yes
And I suppose you could treat
Worth going
people this year if they'd done all their Christmas shopping mail order
Oh yes yes
Rather than sort of go round themselves I reckon we'll take that with us
Good idea
Might want them for a cup of tea
Yeah
I think we should have got away with a small Coke shouldn't we
Mm
That's nice of them
It's so big
We've been thrilled with this work experience cos was Dave originally had these five days off taping and he said no he said you know you're so tired have a little rest we'll go up I'll go up on the train only to get to the S el hu rst Park he's got four or five train journeys
Yeah mm
and he has to get like Wo king to Su r bit on Su r bit on to Clap ham Junction
Yeah
Clap ham Junction to S S er m Thornton He a th and he has Thornton He a th to S el hu rst Park
Mm yes
So it's five trips
Mm
there's no easier
Mm
way
No no
round it and like Dave said it would've cost him sort of seven or eight pound a day in petrol
Mm quite
and he managed to get a ticket for a week
Mm
for fifteen
Mm
pounds
Yes yes quite
You know it
Yes
but er m I bought
sort of quarter past seven he's had to leave in the morning to get there and then not getting home to sort of seven o'clock Dave picks up from the station and I think
Part of life
and I sort of said to him it's he's enjoyed i the hasn't sort of moan ed
No
He he just moans about the fact of making tea
Mm
That just made us laugh because
Mm quite
I said to Dave they've got no idea the youngsters have they
They don't
No
no idea what so ever because er m he starts on this on Monday
Oh God
He's got three er he's got the two languages the three sciences biology chemistry an er m what's the other one
Science
Mm
there and the maths
Mm
So but I think with this I mean this homework that's the only thing I don't believe in because they've gotta rev ise it which is brilliant I mean at the moment but they also give them three hours homework a night
They're not thinking what they're doing are they they're
No I can't talk
overloading
I mean Jim was saying that Winston has given them two weeks off so
Yes yes
alright I don't two weeks is too long I think
Mm
because obviously like Kim very soon after rev i sing she's going out
Yes yes
Er m but I mean you know I think they need to s they should say no homework for this week because they've already
Mm
got a lot
Mm
just go through re vision
Yes
you know two weeks before
Yes
or something no time
Mm
off school
Mm
but total re vision an I mean the other night he sat in he came home at four o'clock and he was up till nine thirty just doing homework
Mm
He's hardly got time to rev ise much cos he's so tired
Mm
And er m he he said it's stupid he said they were given all this and it's the homework it's nothing to do with the re vision you've got to do in his the exams
Yeah ha ha ha
You know it's sort of totally different
Mm
Are we fit or
Just about
Do you want or would like
No
another cigarette
You have another cigarette yeah
I'm shattered
You'll be alright when you get
I'll be fine once once I've had another five minutes
Yeah
Ooh
Well you'll sleep well now always do
Yeah
Did you still put s tilt on cheese in that roll or did you want that
No
Oh
Is that it all or or did you try it
I Haven't needed try Brenda I can't I mean at one time I'd have devoured that
Yeah and me look how much I've eaten
No no I can't I just can't eat so I'm not forcing myself to eat what I'm trying to do is only to eat the right things and I must start vitamin supplements I think I've got the age when I probably need that I mean this cold is a warning to me that my immune system is not as strong as it ought to be I shouldn't have had another cold so soon after getting rid of one
C r i key cos the last time you were down you had that stinker didn't you
Yes yes and this one isn't as bad but I shouldn't be having this one at all
At all no you need either a multi - v i t a m i n or vitamin c
Probably a bit of both
Do you not take any any at all
No no I don't the time has come I think
Ah but tell me what happened about your fracas with Peter
Oh yeah well I won't tape
Yeah I said I honestly can't believe yeah I said I though we had a good working relationship
Mm mm
and you know why
And he said well I'm pretty sure but he said fiftyfifty and I said to him well I said you know you think about it but I'd already sort of made up my mind that I wasn't gonna sort of next year anyway
No no
that that that is it
I mean
As soon as his
Yeah yeah
I said because you know I've had enough
Yeah
of us being used over and over
Er m what difference will it make to your life to have Carla at the secretary
I think I'm not she will then come in and let herself in I have to be in at three
Of course yes yes yes
o'clock
Yes
and for somebody to let her in but
Mm
when she gets she's actually in thirteen
Yes that's right
so she's old enough to have a key
Yes yes
Yes I still would like to be in the house but
Yeah
if I'm not
It's not dis astro us
she's old enough
That's right
to let herself in
And you can work local ly pick up jobs local ly
That's right you know and I still pop in
I mean by by the time all that happens then that'll be next October
Yes it's in
Well
October
by then I may have sold the house and I mean as soon as I sell the house
mm
You can have a couple of thousand for a diner
Yeah
You know you said that Rob is very good on
Yes he is but the thing is cars at the moment are so cheap
They are
I can pick them up
They are
because I mean it it's like anything at the moment it it
Yes
it's sold so cheap
Mm
That er m made me laugh because he said to his secretary er m you know I I honestly don't think your time is she is so down in the mouth
And he had did didn't you say to him haven't you got eyes in your head couldn't you see how
Well
ill I was
still I think it's the fact er m you know y you're not she's got a problem on her mind she's not been well you're not taking her serious
Mm mm
you ought to cut the leash a bit
Mm
which cos I think
Mm
and
Mm
she's obviously you know when you think what she does for you marvellous
Mmm mmm
Er m and she said an also I think she wants to ask you something and you know she asked you before and you've taken no notice
Mm mm
And and he said well do you think I ought to give her you know what about two pound a week
Ah
And she said well look all I'm all I'm
Brenda
saying is that all I'm is er m why don't you er m k e don't think of the money because how valuable is she to you
Quite quite
And it it really shook him up and she turned round and said he turned round and said very valuable
Mm of course
And he said well happens she said what happened if she walked out tomorrow
He said I could never replace her he said e nobody is to she is he said I just couldn't he said I'd you know I'd pay what I'd have to
Yeah
he said we'll be realistic
Mm
he said you know fifteen pounds a week and I said to him what about the petrol
I said you know it's costing fifteen pound a week in a a least and you you're you're paying ten and he said no he said he said I think that's ample he said
It isn't because I keep on going down and filling up the metro with ten pounds worth of petrol and I'm not making a a trip back and forth to work every day
Go on I put that in on Wednesday and I've got to about a quarter of a tank again
Mm
So it'll be
Mm
tomorrow I put it in
And it's an automatic isn't it
They use it up
They use a lot yeah the c h I put it in my I mean I said yesterday to him we've got the decorator s in and then co they turned round and said he is meant to be a businessman and they said he cannot believe they've never met tha such a penny pinching guy
Mm
in all our life
Mm yeah yeah
They come in he said somebody with a house like this the money you've got the cars that got
Mmmm
and he turned round penny pinching saying that you know why has this cost me thirty quid why can't I
Ooh
get it for twenty
Oh yes yes
They nearly walked out last week
Mm
They just honestly couldn't believe that
Yeah
somebody could be like that
But some people are appalling ly mean did I tell you about that Ned being done out of six hundred pounds by an indian doctor and a her husband
No
He put in a kitchen and he thought there was something funny about these people er m they didn't want to give him money up front for the fabric you know the woods and things and he wasn't asking the full amount anyway and he said you know a things are very tight in business and I do not want to run up any more debts if you will let me have some of cash some of the cash fo for the wood as soon as the wood's delivered I'll come and do the job it's not as though your money is going to be tied up in any way and there was a bit of a face pulling and saw this woman drop to sort of always hovering around always putting her mot ty in and er m when th when the job was nearly completed madam steps forward with the cries of that isn't quite right and that isn't quite right and Nev was putting hours doing n it - p i c k i n g fuss ing about getting things absolutely perfect got it absolutely perfect but when it came to the final bill they knocked off six hundred because there was the tiniest little scratch on one of the panel s
Oh he couldn't do anything about it
No it was fi it was fixed in
Perhaps they're fiddling
Ah
a bit
Yes
That's one way to put it anyway and he said that and he said he lost out on six hundred pounds
Six hundred yes
Did he not sort of think to take them to court
I suppose it would have cost him more in court fees
Well I think he can go through the small claims court for five hundred but I suppose six hundred was just over it's probably something very crafty that they thought up between them this pair
It's awful isn't it
Tis awful I was taught as a child in ca tech is m the labour er is worthy of his hire there are four sins that cry out to heaven for justice one of them is a op pressing the widow and orphan and the other is defrauding the labour er of his hire because the labour er is worthy of his hire that's a sin that cries to heaven for justice that's what I was taught as a child
I bet he was really sort of angry
Oh they were they felt sick
But the er it's does he still see them or
Oh no I mean the these were clients and they could never be friends after doing that I've come to the conclusion you can either keep your money or you can keep your friends but you're not going to do both
No
In life
Right shall we make tracks
Yep
and your instrument panel started showing that the wheels had fallen off and one wheel was on fire first thing we had to think was are the reading correct
Get out quick
Yeah
That's it
Ah he flew a thing called the flying coffin
And you had get the two people who were at the back you have to get them out before you landed because when you when you brought the flaps up if they were still in this little bay you would squash them to death and one day his dials showed that he had in fact squashed them to death
Oh
But he hadn't
He hadn't
No
Come on car don't start playing on me now when I want to get home
Ooh don't at the thought of tea
So it's like that without I mean with Carla I mean you can't you know you just can't think when you've gotta I mean she would have been bored and she wouldn't have looked at the gifts
Of course poor little child
No
No
Oh you're clever
Ah ah dear me
I can't get out u any o another other way
No oh dear Neil said yesterday he was running he was running in th r in through the hall way with karate suit or something he was m uttering to himself and he said smoking a healthy dirty habit it's expensive and it shorten s your life I love it
No it's dreadful they are give it up but I said
I with my nerves at the moment
Oh no an it it's it's like slim ming nobody should try to slim when they're feeling tense and agitated and worried about things
I'll go up Tes cos way sure it gets busy over here dunn it though
Yes well
I mean it's not packed though the shops weren't I mean tomorrow morning it'll be m murder there it'll be
Yes
people with kids see at night time
Yes
they don't
Yes
come with the kids
No no I'm looking forward to coming back here in the Spring and having another go at clothes for you and me I'm going to save like mad
Might have won the Jean
Oh I
in the Spring
I should I should have some idea about selling the house
We all know sort of what's sort of happening
That's right
Cos I mean you've got the feeling that didn't you that Neil might move on
Nope I don't think he'll leave me until he marries
No I don't apart from getting married I don't think he'll leave you
No
I th I think though you know after a year or two if he'd moved away an if he moved out the are a he would then break with his mother
Yes
It's the fact that's how I see it
I'm seriously
the fact
thinking
mother was sort up in W is beach
Yeah
and I was in Surrey
That's right
A lot depends on what point I sell my house if I
What price you get
Yeahif I sell at a time when there's still a recession on and you see somebody has to get my they had a visit perhaps that was somebody that actually bought a house not she not
She
they haven't to sold the house they had a visit from a Bank Manager her prefer ent i al mortgage treatment as part of their im monuments they always have had
That's right
the bank seems to pay the a crippling ly low salary demand that everybody dresses in in Sa ville Row but you could buy a house on a something like two and half percent mortgage well it's not like that now but it's still still get a prefer ent i al mortgage and this banking person man was looking around only three or four weeks ago but you see a lot depends on your luck as to whether you pick up a a very good buyer
Is your friends have they had anybody look at theirs yet
They had a couple of people round but no no nibbles or I think yes I think somebody a silly offer because of course all the property pages and places like that Daily Telegraph are urging everybody go on put in an offer for a house put in a silly offer
Yeah
Which is all very well but nobody's phoning in to accept a silly offer
That's right
This is why at the moment I'm being a bit cautious about remaining in my cavity I don't want to find myself in the situation that I'm held to sell
Mm
That's why I'm so keen I shall I tell you what my plan is at the moment but as soon as the the un courteous Bill has decided to move into his new house new flat rather I am going to take my en suite back
yeah I'm going to go back into my bedroom and Neil can still use the en suite shower cos he's got the tip of the idea that he's got to come in clothed and knock on the door cos last time I was in my bedroom he asked if he could use the shower situation he'd you know and I'd let him after all it's not as though my be there's a door between my bedroom and the
Shower that's right
the en suite and er and then I will have three lodge r sI will have Neil
Mind you Neil's not worried about parading around with nothing on is he
Oh well I made him worry
Mm
my goodness I have
Don't you like his new dressing gown he was in
Love that
last time
yes
What was he like when you took cos you took the boxer shorts
Yes
dressing gown and some
all
silly bits oh no sweets biscuits
Yes
was it
some money you spent on me ooh
I bet he was like a big child was he
Yes of course he i she is a poor child I hate to think what Christmas is like for some people
Do you think she'll buy him something
I have no doubt wha did I not tell you about the fact that I hit the roof when he said that she has said that when he was twenty one she was going to buy him a V aux hall Che vette
Sh she's going to
Yes
Well why didn't she pay for his lessons then
Well that's I say
that's when he wanted help
I said it's sh I said I he said don't you think it's a nice gesture
I think that is showing off
I said I
How he's supposed to tax and in sure it and run it have said
Well that's I said that's what I said an and I said where's she going to where are we going to put it
Just because you've passed your test doesn't mean
Oh I
I mean it's years normally before someone can get a car
You can tell what sort of a
You can use
fool the woman is
She is dreadful
Does it strike an answering c ho rd with your mother

I have no doubt that if they owned their council house they would now be very busi ly selling and buying and selling and buying
She's sh she's a bitch she's a oh has she still got that horse
Oh I have no doubt of course I never I despise the woman so heartily that I never ask any questions about it
How does Neil get on with y Philip
Very well they all three get on well together
Oh they do
Yes
I was very surprised about Tony though
Yeah
Cos I remember you saying about he didn't really want to know did he about the ad er er
Neil's boss no no he said oh I think I'll wash my hands of Neil I thought that's another one If I don't stick by Neil
If he was still living with you he wouldn't wash his hands of Neil would he
He might have done he's very a strong mighty chap and I don't know that anything I said could have influenced him and anyway Brenda to be perfectly honest I wo I wo
I wouldn't be doing it I wouldn't dare
I I mean I at the moment I'm not doing anything about Neil's training because we've got coming and it's it's too soon to start stirring up the bud again
I think you probably could have stopped anyway
Yes quite yes
you know wouldn't it
Exactly yes we'll take a breathing space until the new year I mean Neil says that at the moment he'd be quite happy to get into a job where if he was a good worker he could progress in the job and I said an what about doing your radio repairs in the evening but he just he said yes
I said well was it like a part - t i m e thing
Yeah well you see you can make quite a few nice little pounds for yourself if you can say to your friends I can undercut I won't chat while you get across here if you can say to your friends I can do it cheaper than the
Well you can it's like
standard repair
Dave these computer been you know up in the air for about six months and Dave said you've gotta get it repaired he said cos you know y he's gotta print out on it and everything
Aha aha
a lot of his work is sort of rather than getting copies you just do a printout
Yeah
and er m you know and I said Carla needs it for work anyway so Dave said I'm gonna while I'm on holiday I'm gonna do all the stupid jobs so I can take that computer in
Yeah
and he said only cost about twenty cost about twenty five quid to get
Yeah
repaired
Yeah
took it in and they said well they have to send it away and Dave said yeah okay he said well it's forty nine pound before you start
Oh no
and er m providing it's nothing sort of major and that forty nine pounds will cover but if they find anything major they're it's on top of their forty nine pounds
And I said to Dave you need somebody you know like a
Yes
handy man or so something like Neil I mean
Yes exactly
to fix things like that
That's right
so that if they charge twenty quid when they start
Quite
you know half the price
Yes
you know that's
Yes
you could make the money up
Of course you can well I knew of a girl who married I wouldn't say she'd married well when she started out but her husband was enter p rising e eventually got himself quite a good job at the at people who print the bank notes so so that they they started off in a pre fab and they ended up with a new four bedroom bungalow with central heating at A thor pe Rod ing
And er I lost touch with her after that but Joyce was very nice very very a down to earth cock ne y girl from Hock s ton and she said er she'd tell her sister she said I do admire my sister she said they'll never have anything other than a council house I don't suppose but she said my brother - i n - l a w m ends people's motorcycles as a side line and the money that he gets from that he gives her most of it and she buys things on hire purchase this was the days when hire purchase wasn't fearsome ly expensive
Mm
and she said my sister spends I mean we're now talking about nineteen seventy my sister spends twelve and six a week on things from for the house on the hire purchase if she ever truly runs into debt she'll save part of the cost of the thing you know and then she knows that she's always going to have to put twelve and six a week aside but she does that and buys things for the house and you see if you've got if you've got that little bit of extra coming in it's quite well it's like my lodge r s Brenda if I couldn't if I couldn't get what I need from my lodge r s well Neil pays me Neil's house rent which thirty pound a week
And that's not very
No I stop
No
when he gets another job when he gets a proper job when he's employed it'll stop
Oh I see
But at the moment I get thirty pounds a week
I see so if he gets
and if he gets
some money coming in
that's right and he gets some unemployment money and I take ten pounds a week off him for his food I mean it's not enough but it'll do you know and then in d ribs and dr abs be grudging ly from that forty over the week once he starts to run out of money cos he's paid once a fortnight I begin to give him his karate money and here's two pounds fifty to go to the pub with Neil you know little bits
Mm
little bits little bits and I'll buy you your tobacco Neil nothing much but little bits of something now if he were working and could give me the full sixty that is thirty for his room and thirty for his food so that I didn't have to worry about th actually paying for him but he was paying me Paul is going to pay me fifty that's thirty pounds in I made a rule to Paul that he is going to eat thirty pounds worth of food and there are only twenty pounds in my profit and then the other rule a man called Alan this window cleaner he wants the room that I'm in at the moment
Oh dear
because he doesn't want the en suite he can't afford i the can't pay forty pounds a week
Yeah
or thirty five he wants to pay as little as possible
What will you charge twenty five for that one
Twenty five yes an and for that he can make him s he doesn't want to to really to pay me for food at all so I'm going to tell him that he can have his cups spare cups of tea and a drink of milk an and some toast
Just bits and pieces
Yeah
he doesn't want main
No
meals sort of thing
Or main meals no but he can have that on the twenty five he needn't give me anything extra for that
When's he moving in then as soon as
Well he was probably actually hammering on the door now to er come and see where he's going to put his ladder she wanted er a bit of wall to put the b rackets up to put his ladders but Paul said that he Paul thought you could suspend ropes from my garage roof you remember what a lot of criss - c r o s s b racing there is
Have you seen what we've done in our garage
No I haven't
We took er m just wood beams across for canoes
Or if
might as well up there
Richard put over put a lot of beams and Paul at the weekend put an immense amount of his household gear up on the roof in the garage
In the garage yeah that's what we did we
Yes
the ladder and
Yes
everything on the beam
Yes well it's possible that er Alan may see a way to using that but he is quite ni I mean he he's got no doubts he wants to come to me he's in a divorce at the moment and the moment that the final papers are signed he's got to get out of the house he has to stay there till the last minute and then the moment that the papers are signed he must go
But what happens if Philip 's still there
Well Alan says he'll sleep on my sofa
On the sofa for now yeah
I mean h he under he says this is you know a very nice house and he wouldn't normally expect to get a room for twenty five pounds in a house of that character
That's right but twenty five quid is a hundred quid a month inn it
Precisely
Well it's it's say I say I was doing my best as it were say that everything was going swimming ly I'd be getting a profit of thirty pounds from Neil twenty pounds from Alan because five will go on the tea and the milk and the box of Corn flakes and the toast er twentythirty that's fifty and twenty for Paul which is seventy
You get thirty from Paul don't you
No he's going to give me fifty because don't forget he's in a small bed and he eats thirty pounds worth of food
Twenty pound from that's seventy quid
exactly
The price is considerably better
Two eighty a month
Exactly much much better than any poke s in the eye with a sharp stick
So what does it did Philip pay up on time
Always excellent on that yes he's a toad in some ways but in other ways he's very good
What about Paul
Well he hasn't got any money but when he's had it he's paid on the dot the only one
But hasn't he got that job still then
At
He's only just started
Oh he's just started
And he has to week before he gets any money he has to work a week in ar r ears you know they they
So has he been there this week Paul
Yes he's been there this week
Next week he'll get paid
money yes
So from next week you start getting paid
Yes and if that bloody Karen comes on the scene and wants to take him back I shall tell her if you go back Paul
That's it
that's it I'm having no more of it
I've had two lots of terrible upheaval s
Mm he can't you know he's
He mustn't
That's right you're gonna sort of
Build a trench ha ha oh ha oh oh ha ha
Yeah he you can't keep on and on helping them out I mean they've gotta
No
themselves I mean
Quite
Shan't be sorry to see Philip go will you
Oh I can hardly wait
I mean I I went in there yesterday I think it was or this morning er m he put wet shirts into the wardrobe admittedly with the doors open but that bedroom is not a bedroom that I like to get any damp ness in at all Brenda
Why does he just hang it you know put in the tumble dryer or hang it in the garage
Too lazy
Easier to do it that way
Has Tony taken all his stuff out
Yeshe has at last
Is he in his house yet or is he still in that
Yes and he's very very difficult to feed himself to get the food in because you know he liked to come in a half past ten and bully me to cook things for him that's why sometimes I used to run up to bed and pretend I was asleep
Asleep
So what er so how does he cope now then
Cos I thought that was a with a utmost difficulty and he has to get his little daughter on Sunday to help him to clean the place
She'll soon get fed up with that
Well tough he's not getting my he's not getting the en suite room I can tell you If I if I have got three lodge r s and I'm getting on with them and they're they're paying me regularly for the sake of an extra twenty pounds or whatever and the annoyance from Tony coming in at ten a or there about s and then sitting there like a stuffed frock waiting for me to leap about and put food on a plate and microwave it not doing it Brenda
No you shouldn't I mean you
I mean I w when I was dropping dead with exhaustion one evening I said to him look Tony the there's I've cooked a chicken there's a big chicken cooling on the table and there there were red sauce potatoes gravy I said stick the lot on a plate a mi c ro and you know film it over microwave it oh well I shan't bother to eat anything now of course he was paying me for his food
Mm
and he was jolly well seeing whether
But if you'd said oh well I'll prepare what about if I prepare you oh yes well I'll have that probably if you'd got done it he'd have it because he had to help himself
Oh well I th I then said oh well I'll alright I'll fling it together for you oh good can you bring it into the sitting room
I very nearly brought it o
See don't
in the sitting room and banged it over his head
Tell you something I'd like to pick up tonight if I see it is a bloom ing couple of trays
You know Paul has lent me some very clean but very ugly old fashioned trays of the sort that people have in restaurants that his mother lent him and they're they're a God send
I tell you really I mean I used to have one and went to look
beautiful trays in John Lewis's this morning I was licking my lips with desire Brenda
The amount of ti sometimes I feel like a bowl of soup especially with not being I felt like a bowl of soup and then
Yes
not wanting to sit in the conservatory
It's cold
winter and then you know you have to sort of use a plate to
Yes
and Dave said why don't we
Yes
have a couple of trays and I know it's so easy
Mm
and we had a couple Mark's had them I sa but they wanted fourteen ninety nine
Yes
I mean they probably are quite expensive but I mean I I'm sure A and N or somewhere De ben hams or somewhere would have them
De ben hams probably but the John Lewis's were excellent and some some of them were tin and I do wonder if you're eating on your lap a tin tray might be rather cold but on the other hand you let the heat from the plate through to your poor little legs
I never noticed that
No
All - w e a t h e r pitch
Yeah
And we had one rug by pitch
Yes Is this where Jenny used to live or still lives
Up there by those weather boards
Oh yes yes
What about have you heard from them lately
Yes she wrote to me I'll tell you what when I get back I'll pop her letter in the post to you she seems alright
Who Jenny
Yes they've s ti they've stayed together she still mark you in the letter she does come across as a misery guts
They all do don't they
What about have you heard any more of her cos she was having trouble with her husband wasn't she
Yes she still phoned me up in the morning and at vast expense to tell me how awful everything was
Still bad is it
Oh I phoned her back a few days later and said how are things now
Oh they're alright she said
I expect Jenny her kids are off at school now aren't they
They are and I I think the whole trouble with Jenny was that not having I mean I was alright as a sort of mum subject I wasn't the same as a bona fi de mum that could be called upon in all weathers at all times to do everything
I don't
And I think she found looking after tiny children a bit too much for her
Didn't like she was more the career girl wasn't she I think
She should have stayed in beauty therapy she's a very gentle and she's very able
She's very good at it wasn't she
Very good and kind and small children are cruel noisy and demanding and unless
That's right
you've got a soul of steel a heart of steel you can't cope with the bugger s
the bath off
And obviously I think there was a little bit left in there
Yeah
Cos you can't get your hand right to the bottom without a I mean
Mm
it shot down the hole
Mm
So it's a right pain
Unless there's a special fluid or something they could put it in there to wash through
You can't because it wouldn't come out through the taps would it
For someone like Nigel who's got all the tools it it'd be a a it's not a job you can come in and just do it cos you have to take a bit off clean it
and then a bit more cleaning
Mm
I haven't got any of the tools
Mm no but it even for a
plumber it's a big job
Be a bloody long job
Well no not really cos you could find once you've found it once he's where you found the c log
So is that Lee jacket that's got a hole in it
Marked at the top and yeah
Why
Well cos it had sunk and fallen that's why going cos the jacket had s fallen
What the new jacket we got off Lee
Yeah it filled with water it'd gone into the tank
But why why did it
Well it must have had a split in or something
Mm
The si it's all round the sides you don't really need a top on a tank it's just the sides you want
Can you come on the neo have you come on the insurance
Can you come on Les and can he come on his insurance
I doubt it
I mean estimated
Ah
because Nigel like privately
We didn't we haven't cos Les has to go through the books and charge
Ah yes of course
so we do it we have like Nigel as our own plumber
Ah yes yes
and he doesn't charge he charges still
Mm yes
but not as much
Mm
And me being a silly idiot see if I'd realized I didn't think you don't think that there's three parts of the tank you think it's a tank and you just turn your tap on and the water comes out or
Do you know Dave I read er m we there's a magazine called Good Housekeeping and it's been going for it had been going for seventy years last year it started in nineteen twenty one women's magazine very good one and they had a sort of seven tie th birthday issue
Do you want a cup of tea now
and one woman said that the year nineteen twenty one she was a bride of eighteen years old and she took Good Housekeeping and she's got the whole lot although she's now a very old lady and she said my first lot of housekeeping was done in a house in Wales where we had water from the well we had to build the fires up by hand we could get Welsh coal cheap ly but they had to you know use paper and kindle and we swept with brooms and my life has never been easier she said I had three children in four years and my life has never been easier she said and all these modern things came in life has got more and more complicated and difficult
You're not kidding he certainly ain't kidding you now now it's happened to me I know if it ever happened I know never to do it again
The the the bugger at i on of it is that the next time round that something goes wrong it'll be again something that you've encountered before
Yes yes and me and there's one
Bugger
thing house I never touched electric s anything gas electric s it's funny me and are absolute disaster
Yeah yeah
I mean whatever I touch
Yeah
with the plumbing it so
Plumbing is very difficult er m
I hate it
Years ago I had a class of very bright children and they did some really good projects they weren't silly projects where they just scribble a bit an and draw some rubbish the they really worked and I saw to it that they produced really good work
Yeah
and one boy chose to write about plumbing and do you know he found that there was nothing written down about plumbing in the early nineteen seventies there were one or two plumbing text books they were very expensive and you could only get them through The Institute of Plumber s plumbing is something that until about nineteen seventy five was passed from father to son or uncle to nephew it was a sort of secret craft you know you can
It can
understand it
Yeah
Yes
Yeah I still I watched Nigel I mean I can dig some of that
Got a burning in the tum now
What dear
Got a burning in the tum
Oh yes you would have I mean that that i it is a
stress symptom yes and it's not funny I've had it
So did Carla go off okay
Yeah
Oh could I ring home
Course you can
Thanks very much
Put your glasses on to see
Oh yes
Can you spot a little clip
Oh the little clip

Oh yeah it is
is at eight o'clock
He's probably down the pub
Try later
Doesn't go to er m his brothers or something afterwards
Yes yes and I expect either Phil or Paul is driving him and which ever it's
And
possible that Paul has had a already had a reply from the Destiny people you know the ap at my urging Paul joins these people to find himself another girl because I'm so sick of hearing about Karen who's treated him made a fool of him totally
Mm
and er if Paul has had a phone call from one of these woman then he's been off like a shot
I've lost the little silver thing
What sort of little silver thing is it
It's a little just a funny shaped bracket thing it's sort of stand
Oh I didn't notice that I saw that thing in the car but I didn't notice a bracket
Yeah well I had it here so I dropped it
Ah
It's probably floating round
It's probably in th in the internal works of the chair
So what did Jim have to say much
No not really
When's he coming back

They did they say they got water hammer we went into the ladies toilets and one door one cubicle was shut and there was this loud drumming noise and I said to Brenda perhaps it's an alarm signal perhaps somebody on the other side of that door has been taken ill and has pressed some sort of alarm signal anyway we went out and they said oh no it's always making that noise
Did they
Well

Yeah
Yes for that I don't know cos in wo one oh actually it might be this they've added this s te Essentials actually on conversation it is a you end up with so many don't you
Yeah
And I haven't thought like that really
Oh
and half of it is rubbish and decent rubbish and that's rubbish there it is I knew it was in here somewhere I knew I thought it was in the Prima they gave it to you but obviously it was er m in Essentials everything out of there don't think they had many Christmas You used to was it you you see you can make your own was it you that we went up to town that time and brought those er m from John Lewis the round
Mm
it was you
Mm
did you use it
Yes
For what
Well I tried to fix them on the door and they wouldn't stay
No
There was unless I was prepared to put a r u d d y great nail through my door I couldn't hang the thing
What did you decorate them or did you just leave them plain
Well they were decorated weren't they they were rings with and they had little tiny boxes little colour ed like little parcels sewn on
Oh
Oh no I thought you bought just some plain green ones
No
No
No no
Perhaps we were going to and then decided
Mm
against
And I tried to fix it to the door and it wouldn't I tried to do it up with B lu - T a c k and would have none of it I tried to do it with Sell o tape and wouldn't do it the Sell o tape kept on coming away something in the varnish I think that resisted that so then I thought right I'll I'll tie the thing up in some way I forget how and blew away went down the drive
I didn't mean to laugh when you said it it blew away down the drive
You can just imagine this bloody thing dr i flying away down the drive
yeah so I chased off after it one of the little boxes had come loose and carted it back to the house I said your going to be a Christmas decoration whether you like it or not
So first of all I put it on a little er I've got a rather nasty little table that looks as though it ought to have a chamber pot underneath it you remember that nasty little wooden bedside table that I hate
Oh yeah yeah
so I put it on the top of there every time anybody went by they knocked it off
In the end I simply flung it on the
Away
middle of the dining room table
Mm
with cries of get on with it
That's half half the trouble with home decoration is it's not practical
No no I was gonna say some you know just sort of just some ideas are good but I tell you haven't they got some beautiful er m candle holders around this year some really unusual ones
Ooh yes
Well the one I saw in Liberty's it was eight ninety five it was that high
Was it that well that was quite good
and it was dark green oh it it's not bad but you know I'd just lost ten pounds to the taxi driver to him giving me the wrong change so I was feeling in a very f rug al mood an and this the green of this candle stick holder you know what I call the old fashioned dark green of some china
Mm

Mm quite shows how desperate they all are to get rid of their Christmas gifts
Well Debs has never done one
No no and very often they charge you for one a tremendous amount illustrated
Mm
Yeah Oh Brenda ah ha ha ha

I love that look at that
Ah
Ever worn them
What's that dear
The bas que thing they're called
No
Bas que
Gerry would never have allowed it
I used to make myself
If he did he wouldn't you wouldn't of kept it on would you
No I can't go
You wouldn't of kept it on long
I would not well
I think that that Christmas tree is definitely you
Mm
That forty nine
Mm
pound
Mm
cos I mean that
Mm
did you hear that woman behind
No
Said she would never think she said I thought it was real
Yes
She said she said the one next to it
Yeah
she said now that looks artificial but I would never have thought the
No
cheaper one
No
The fifty nine pound that looked one that looked
Mm mm
but I know it cos the other week when I had to work till half past eight for Peter he was having a dinner party and er m we went down there I had to go shopping with him he made me die cos he asked me if I'd work a bit later and I said yeah I need the money so I'll work later so er he made me die because he said in this flare up this argument when when I worked that day I mean I worked all day I had nothing to eat and I couldn't eat af you know cos of this trouble I couldn't eat after
Mm
four o'clock
Mm
and er anyway he got home about half past three so we had to go down to Marks went down to Marks came back and he bought me a sandwich I said I've eaten nothing all day bought me this sandwich I was hoping to go away at six
Mm
and at eight o'clock I went home and anyway he went to pay me my weeks money and h he gave me an extra ten pound
Mm
I thought that's big of you I mean I would have charged him more anyway
Mm
but
Mm
I didn't I thought
Mm mm
Oh well
Mm
he's
Mm
given me ten pound bonus
Mm
and when we were having this argument on Wednesday he said I said we what what was your reason then for not paying me for that when I was genuinely sick and he said er oh he said because I gave you such a good bonus last week I said what was that then he said er m twenty five pounds I said no you didn't
No
I said you know I did some extra hours for you
Mm mm
oh yes he said I've worked it out those extra hours I've paid you for them but I thought you actually worked for them for nothing and I've just given you a bonus
Oh good god
and er
This man is pathological ly mean
Well the these
Pathological ly mean
these decorator s just could not believe how
No

No
they were just so amazed
Yeah yeah
Just you know th th well they just couldn't just couldn't believe that somebody could actually you know sort of react sort of in in that way
Mm
I'm saying everything's turned off at the moment alright
Was it
No he's not sure he don't think it is that h he's he's gonna cut the gas he said it's not right the er central heating pumps are well ho the said it shouldn't be like that so he to there's a little box up there he thinks it's probably this box but he's he's trying to figure out what it is up there because he's he's just such amazed at price of pieces
Mm
trying to work out exactly what's going round might have a
But did you tell tell him that it doesn't get that hot in the conservatory
No that's
Nothing to do with that and the radiator key
No can't be that no don't worry about that
It's a worry isn't it
It is I don't know
I suppose even sort of with a with a plumber you know y you don't I mean I suppose they don't always know what they're looking for
Well no because unless they put the system in and know exactly what it was there are so many different ways of delivering water
Mm the thing is the guy that used to live here was such a bloody pr at
Oh like Brian
A didn't help chap
Oh oh my dear
And the jobs we've found
Yes
that that's gone wrong because he's a do - i t
Quite
yourself chap
Quite yes
it's just totally unbelievable
Yeah well this is my this my
Yeah
this is the story of my life now in the bathroom I have had I have had to pay a hundred pounds to Mr Butcher the plumber to put in a new shower thing because that was cheap and rough and eventually wore out should never have been put in
What about your leak that came through the ceiling is that cleared now
Oh it's doing it again it's doing it again dear oh yes doing it again er m I had the plumber up to look at that cos I thought the plumbing was all wrong and he said no he said the plumbing is wrong the waste pipe of the en suite shower and the bath are connected and they shouldn't be they should be separate but they had been connected and that is bad but no he said what's happening is quite simple he said er m the people using the en suite can't control the water it's going out he said the curtain doesn't fit flush against the wall because the wall leans you know
Mm
and he said water is getting out he said tell people to be more careful and put towels all round so in my lovely en suite I've got old towels all round my surround
Oh
I love that
God
Brenda I adore it it's me all over so the bathroom I had endless trouble as you know with Shirley I had to buy stuff and Shirley came in and I gave her little presents of this and that and helped her with cooking meals for her she re - g r o u t e d practically my bath til es and my en suite til es because we thought water was going through the wall and it was and then I had to replace the where you take the plug out in the bath I forget what you call that the trap
Mm
all that has had to be replaced because that was starting to drip down into the hall again
And then I had to th the shower just came you know came to pieces in our hand as it were it was not working as a shower so a plumber had to come Mr Butcher came into me
unscrewed the whole lot and he said this is cheap old rubbish
It's continental and is not is not U K and that was a hundred pounds more or less for his fee and and buying a and buying at a discount through somebody who I knew buying this new shower and the tappy things you know
Mm
the mixer things that's the bathroom
And the next thing that's going wrong in the bathroom will be that I'll have to replace that central heating pump
Is that going wrong then
It's it makes an awful noise in the morning
I I've got a bill to come in from the electrician for his call - o u t charge he diagnosed that it's was not an electrical fault and then thought it was an electrical fault by the noise it was making a f iz z ing noise but he doesn't th he said it's it's the pump the pump is on the way out it needs replacing house is built in nineteen eighty five
So the bedrooms and they're not too bad because he hasn't been able to do anything in the bedrooms the bedrooms are alright except that over the l intel s in most of the bedrooms the plaster is is not right it's it's flak ing in great lumps and rippling and cracked something to do with the
So was he the guy that did everything himself then
Yes and he hadn't the faintest idea of how to do it
But that flak i ness and that is obviously when it was new he didn't let it dry out he just painted
Quite
over it
That's right so you then go into the en suite room well I cannot tell you the trouble I've had from the en suite
Water pouring through into the kitchen water pouring down the electric wire of the lamp in the study
What from there
Yes and eventually Shirley and I thought well I mean we spent weeks g routing we g routed and we g routed and still water was coming through and we g routed and at last it seemed to be dry and the man came and did the re - a r t e x i n g on the insurance and I had wa new wallpaper put up for which I paid extra because he only allowed eight pounds a roll the insurance company only pays eight pounds a roll and I had eleven pound wallpaper and a border and having got the whole thing up the s the patches have appeared again
And they won't pay out again will they
Oh no er and I
Did they come and check it first or they just
No no they just take your word for it and now I have got as I said I've got that I've got to paint that over and re seal and I've got to make sure that nobody makes a mess in there but the plumber said what you really need to do is to get rid of this cheap and t at ty horrible plastic tray which doesn't come right to the edge of the til es
Mm
and buy a screen five hundred pounds he says
Mm very clever isn't he
I just looked at the man I thought I oh god I can't cope with this
So you've just got a curtain round it
Mm
Mm
So you come down the stairs and you come into the kitchen in the kitchen we start with the refrigerator being put next to the cook er
Mm
and I've had that taken out because I couldn't I just could not stand it especially in hot weather
You've got a new cook er haven't you
I've got a a a well I got a new cook er had a have a new cook er because when they took the old one out it was already in seven separate pieces
Those bloody useless one though
He bought it off the town dump so new fridge - freezer in the cu which is now free - s t a n d i n g in the corner bought it from Doug
Oh I've seen that
you know reduced price but never - t h e - l e s s money new cook er gas hob removed because that was going U S and an electric hob put in the formica in the kitchen if you remember when you first saw me it was til es it wasn't formica it was ghastly til es and when Ned lifted all that out it was black with with rotten mould
Mm
The man hadn't g routed the til es in properly he'd used some sort of rough old cement and the water was just going through and staying there
Oh my God
Fortunately Ned gave me that pink formica and the new sink as a present
So you didn't to buy it
Ha what else have we got
Gas fire
The gas fire I have formed a really deep and meaningful relationship with Andy at Ang lia Gas he's been back and forth to my house I know all about the fact that he hasn't got a girlfriend and his mother is a marvellous cook and that W or ling worth is a bit off the map he and I are buddies dear
I hate to think how much money I have paid over to Ang lia Gas if I'd known what I was into I could have walked into that house then and I could while I had all that money before I gave any away I could have said right I'm going to have to spend that that that that and that and I would have done it and it would have I would've been alright because I wouldn't have had things going wrong
Is it still working now the fire
Yes
But after about three hundred quid inn it
Ha I could have had a lovely new one
That's th the trouble is they keep repairing they don't tell you this do they I mean
No
they could have sort of said look
In the end I bullied Andy I said Andy there is something fishy about this fire he said well it's possible he said that it was er m a display model and every time anybody came in and needed a replacement part instead of sending for the part they took it out of the display model
God what was that bloke
Was he a youngster or what was he that lived in your house
Well youngish he'd got youngish children you know
Bloom ing idiot weren't he
Well totally
I mean next time I buy a house I shall say excuse me but are you a bloom ing idiot
Are you gonna be but these D A Y D I Y
Oh
are okay if they know what they're doing but I mean th this this guy I mean
My lovely Gerald was very very clever he was a mechanic he was a graduate mechanical engineer and he knew everything about cars that needed to be known
M hm
And he thought as a result that he knew about everything else as well and Brenda he didn't
No
Because another way in which I had to throw good money after bad was that after he died once I started having things done in the house they kept on turning up things that he had done that were absolutely N B G
the al do you remember those wires hanging about in
Yeah
the kitchen
The electrician turned quite white when he saw them
I know that was you but y you don't I mean I remember u the fire we used to have here and it wasn't till I gave it to a friend I mean we kept here for a year alright lucky enough we didn't use it anyway I gave to a friend who doing car boot I found it in the attic an he said to me Brenda he said did you ever use this fire
He said well obviously you didn't he said cos you'd be dead
I said why I
He said how are y he said the wiring on this he said if you plug this in he said ho you'd electrocute yourself
I say
I said you're joking and I said they sell the house to you
Yes
you know and you
Yes
plug it in and they
Mm
obviously just left it luckily
Mm
enough we did
I'm going to ask some very very straightforward questions when I buy the next house
Well
and I'm going to write down the answers they give me and get them to sign them because I have I have really been beaten about the head by this
Well it's I mean you know it's I I don't think I could live with the conscience if I was selling I would say well look
No I couldn't I mean and these people are J eh ovah Witnesses who sold me this house and my feelings about the commercial prob it y of J eh ovah Witnesses are that they haven't any commercial prob it y
They're they're probably so wrapped up in their devotion that they don't bother about standard commercial morality it was sh a shocking thing to do
I mean if I were to sell my house now supposing somebody came galloping in along before Christmas ooh ooh I want the house on the first of Fe b and they'd come and they'd see the house and they say yes I want it want it want it and it was plain that they were going to want it and we started to talk money as soon as we'd got the solid block of money I want one O two you er estate agent tells me I can get ninety seven between ninety five and ninety seven say they offer me ninety six
Mm
say we'd be you know be fiddle around and get to ninety six I would then turn and say to them I will give you five hundred pounds I will knock five hundred off that so that you can put in a proper shower tray and screen
Mm
put in by
That's it
by Mick of De ben ham because I understand from him that that is what's needed
Mm
I just would not
But even if you didn't sell I mean but death trap things electrical things I mean you would
Quite
sort of feel you know I mean I've known people where I mean it was like us the day we moved in here
Your con sci o as you say
went to bed that night and thought gas you know and the bloom ing boiler lucky it didn't blow up
I mean it had all it had gone
You know I mean the next day we had the gas man out
Mm
and said we you know we we lucky we weren't gassed
Oh Brenda Brenda
You know I mean people are so sort of un un trustworthy and
Yes
well they're just not honest are they
No no they're not
You know I mean alright y you wanna sell your house and everything but I mean for goodness sake I mean
You've got to live with yourself
That's right I mean
What I have said to Neil and Neil is honest but once or twice he's said things and I've said no Neil
No that's wrong
There it's better to be it's only poor and have your self respect
Mm
than to try to take a mean and petty advantage of anybody or anything
That's right
He's only said these things sort of trying out to see because he doesn't he doesn't know if very much oh it's so sad Brenda he said to me we were talking on Wednesday night I think and he looked wistful ly at me and he said I only want to be taught
Ah
I only want to be taught
So he's just like a child isn't he
Well he is I say that he's six he's twenty going on sixteen
Th doesn't the doesn't the stepfather sort of say anything
No what what does what do modern men think about Brenda you tell me your Dave
isn't it
is a one in a thousand one in a thousand like my my Gerald that thought about his duties his responsibilities his tender fatherly fig
We'll get the stuff in then
Yeah
When she's gone off the
Yeah yeah
cos I dare say we'll la tis h in bed cos you won't be that late with Marge in bed will you tomorrow night
No no
Not of Maureen spoken to her lately
Well yes I had to spend quite a lot of time on the line to her because er her husband's been quite ill with bladder trouble
That's right I remember you saying
And she was very worried and kept on crying down the phone and saying now I know what you went through with Gerry I said oh come you know
Has it gone off again Dave
No well I
in the kitchen
central heating central heating and all
If it's the and that down it he couldn't see a block age
Mm
And as soon as he put some fun nels and that down it rods pressure came back
Mm
So you can't but what Dave's saying is i if lighting the boiler and then it's going
It's switching in and out is it
switching off and
Oh
the water's stone cold
Yeah yeah
touched that he touched several things
What I'll do so is anything sucked down into the boiler or
Right I'll turn the central heating off
What about the didn't you say tha what was the central heating thing why was that hot

Bet that boiler has already had it
What's the boiling point of water people
It's a hundred Dave
Ooh
Is it so what would be si sixty five being a reasonable temperature for hot water for a bath
hot in the tank
Obviously you've gotta have cold too
You nearly ready
What just sixty five in a bath
Well not sixty five water
Sixty five from the hot tap
Oh what do you think it is then
so
Well it's about I mean that's normal about sixty sixty
About
five
Yeah
Has it gone
Yeah
up again then
It has but I've turned the stat back up on the cylinder just made the boiler cut in again cos that's that's why the boilers cutting out cos it what it does once it gets up to temperature then it'll shut itself off
Where's the thermo stat for that then upstairs in the attic
On on the tank
Yeah but why would it be all of a sudden need to turn it up now
I've turned it down
Oh you've turned it down
Yeah
I thought you meant a
See it might have reached temperature before I mean I don't know I can't do a
I mean it's been
do you have
apparently alright I mean
do you have cold water coming out
it was put the boiling w w really hot
Yeah
and then
what hotter than normal
Well I thought it was yeah
But you don't you remember Carla had a bath Sunday she ha we had a bath about nine o'clock and then when we got back she went to have her bath and she got in it and it was stone cold
Ah
I actually hear Lisa the other night she was coming out of the bath oh she said the bath 's cold
There's no hot water was there
Mm
And it was about three hours later and I said to her
It's really cutting out a lot
Might be the stat playing up
There thermo stat
Yeah on the
Mm
from the er m tank see what it does once
How much long do they last
when it get's up well who knows sort of thing once it gets up to temperature
Mm
it like sends the thing down the old wiring and flicks the boiler off the same as with the heating once it gets up to temperature the boiler will cut off
Yeah
That might be that
So does it that a new one
that's on there
Yeah
Well it's
Would have they put when they put the boiler in cos the boiler w we've had in three years
Yeah well you have before you had an immersion heater didn't you
Yeah it's not
a new cylinder there though is it
Yeah cos they did a lot of work didn't they or they should have done er
see on another
they'd have to put
they put the new bo o the only thing we had everything new three years ago except for the they did all the work in the attic
Quality system yeah well i that boiler that's in the airing cupboard that do you know
No they do
No they must have had a cylinder there already
Yeah no they just put pipes and that they run in there
Yeah
Different pipes but
I'll see what's new and what's old and what
Yeah
they'd have done
Mm
Who done it Brian
Brian and
who's the other one
Jeff
No
No not big Left y
Lofty Left y
Oh Brian
Brian yeah
And er
Left y
Left y yeah
Yeah they did it
That's that now see I before did you have was your heat heating the hot water on the immersion
Well we don't know cos the day we moved in
Oh yeah
it blew up
It was a Ser vow arm boiler in there
Oh right
Ser vow arm in there and then Les
but the heating
would
boil I think there is a there's a thing there for the
Yeah that's that's what I mean it's if it if it run on the immersion before then you wouldn't have had that tank stat on there
You don't we were u we had to use the immersion didn't we cos w we moved in in the June and Lofty and Brian said well don't have it done cos you're not gonna use until August so we they did it August time for us so but we didn't use Ser vow arm cos it had blown up they just disconnected it for us so we used the ho the immersion heater
until they came

He does
Yeah yeah
Mm
Wears he wears white Swiss cotton and he'll change half way through the day depending on whether he's got you know in fairly important meetings
They they they buy very expensive things don't they

And also of course he goes on the building sites he's still wearing a suit
muck aren't they
Got a a yellow hat and and a sweet little well ing tons but never - t h e - l e s s there's the dust and the muck lying about
How often does he have to change the suits you know how long do they last

Probably Reading
Not sure I must ask her where he does he goes to a Marks where they always have every possible man's suit that Marks make and and he takes the time to buy two or even three because he doesn't get that much time for shopping
No he doesn't get that time what about his shirts where are his shirts from

The thermostat's the worst thing inn it
You've gotta
Brenda they are

I've got to I've got to replace that pump I've got to brace myself on that one
The thing is you've got to it's it's like Nigel I mean he works for my uncle er m and he had the other guy Mark working for him for a few years and then he employed Nigel but Mark wasn't a fully qualified plumber and Nigel was and he's ooh I don't know about I think he's about nineteen or no he's about twenty three I think yeah

I buy everything from him but I've got to buy another tumble dryer er m I've been drying clothes off in the house and the three men and all them well two of them wearing work wear jeans and the next one that comes in will be wearing jeans it's no go I just cannot dry stuff off in the house I've just got to have a tumble
Too busy
And the tumble
Have you got a tumble dryer then
Yesbut it's an old thing
So we freeze to death
What's the what's going on
Well he doesn't know he turning it off and he says we've gotta sort of try it and if for some reason the water gets red hot we've gotta turn the whole system down
Mm
And off
Right
No no
Are you sure
Yeah
Paying him
Alright then I'll find out and er
Cheers Ni g
Alright
Thanks a lot So
Yeah
So what can't we have the heating on then
You can in a minute yeah
Oh yeah
You can have the heating on I'll I'll check it about ten minutes but if the hot water gets really really hot then it's the thermo stat and
Mm
he said turn turn the hot off but you can
Mm
still have the central heating on
Mm
And he's going to have a chat with er m one of the blokes tomorrow and he's tomorrow afternoon but he's he's cured the water
The block age
Well he's he there's a couple of a little boxes up there little el e electronic boxes
Mm
and they do it electrically or you can do it manually and he's turned them round manually and now the water's coming out normal put them back to how they were
Mm
so he said perhaps that it there was a fault in there it's cured itself
Mm
Mm mm
You
He was go
would never have known that would you
No but he's said
No
those er he said there's something going down the pipes I said no cos that pipe there you can put your finger where that pipe is now and the water's flying out
Is it
So it weren't nothing blocking that up
Mm
But what so i it does he think something from the ga cos it keep coming on and off
Well he don't know cos he don't know how those figure out how they work
It's always coming on and off though inn it
Well I don't know I never s stood and listened to it
Yeah it's always yet if you run a tap now turn the hot tap on that'll come on
You haven't got
again
you haven't got any hot water at the moment that's why I said that should well I would have thought he did it but you got no hot water then that should keep going until the water stops
No it doesn't you run the top tap now in the kitchen turn it off that will ignite and come on go and try it
Yeah but you the thermo stat on your tank is telling should be telling that that you've got a cold tank that's what thermostat's for
Well no because it'll tha it doesn't work like that it takes about cos it's cold it's gonna take about an hour to warm up and that won't come on that'll just cu keep coming on and off all the time till it's hot ten ed up
Will it
Yeah it won't I mean that won't stay on for an hour I mean I've literally had a hot bath put the water on you know af it goes off at nine o'clock in the morning put that radiator put that button on to reset the hot water for five minutes it's bo boilers lit up ten minutes and then it's gone off
Mm
and I think a but you couldn't go and have a bath cos the water will be stone cold
Mm
No there's something wrong
No it's always been like that
Well I would never have thought of that
Yes because y if you've used all your hot water you can't have that boiler going for an hour or two can you
Why
Cos it'll be so hot it gets so hot that boiler
Well it's it's like you trying to say you're gonna boil a pan of potatoes and you've gotta keep turning it off every two minutes cos it'll be getting too hot
Well no because there's a ba pa pan of potatoes is a bit different to
It's not no y you using a you put a boiler in for a purpose is to heat your water up inn it
Yeah I suppose so
Yeah do you like me like this
No
Let me see if I've still got pressure see if we see what you think gotta pick her up
Yeah half past nine
Wanna see the
Did you do much in rehearsals tonight

one boy stays over one comes back
M hm

But there'll be
Oh
there there'll be a paddle so pretending there's a paddle

Including that
Mm
We need in we don't need this

You're bar red
You know if ever you're in any sort
of a well not exactly a disaster but if ev if ever you're in some sort of uncomfortable plight er stuck in a train or anything like that the way t to cope is to go off to sleep if you can
Mm
and
Do I have to take that
No it's my tupperware box
I know is that
Very expensive
It doesn't need to be all all that it needs t to do is to just demonstrate

Why don't you use
Yes it does
the other cardboard box and paint the cardboard box

Yeah but it don't look like a sh like it does with a shoe box
Yeah
And let that sit in the shoe box and then tape the shoe box

It's too fat to be in a shoe box
No I don't think it is
Get a big box if you got a big box from the super market tomorrow painted it then it

Get dad to
I don't think he'd wanna stay five hours

Joe
He's in hospital
Why
Because he's not very well and I might say him
what he can say that he'd go with her but he'd had to be back sort of by four cos he's going out with you he says that that'll get him out of it then won't he
Daddy's taking him out
Cos Gill's phoning him
about ten thirty what time's he coming in tonight

Mum what can I make a paddle out of
Pencil
No
Lo ll y stick
Lo ll y stick
It's only gotta be a little tin foil
Cocktail stick
One of those bud things
Yeah cotton buds
Sort of cut in half
That looks like a paddle
It does look like a paddle
No even with the white things
Cotton buds
We can leave the white things
Ear picks
Yeah
In the bathroom
Like Johnson's baby buds
It looks like they're a paddle doesn't it
Yeah
The things you put in your ear
Yeah
Yeah
Can I cover that in tin foil
Or you could leave it on it's own couldn't you cos it's got the white things like dad's
Oh yeah
got th that shaped at the end
Yeah

That's quite a good i go and get one and see that you cover it tin foil if you want but it'll probably be alright as it is
What a brain box ah
Yeah
Oh between the lot of us we must have some intellect
I bet that hasn't gotta be in for a week
I bet she's the only one in the whole class doing it
There's a
Yeah quite likely quite likely
She's got to please the teacher all the
She's enthusiastic
so much
She's very
and she
very well motivated
Every night she comes out I've gotta do the homework it'll gotta be in tomorrow normally gets a week
When's this gotta be in by then Carla
Well look well you can do it if you want to do it but i
Mm
but you know you don't have to do it
When I think of the difference between Carla and Neil Neil doesn't really want to do anything
Oh she's gotta be
Absolutely bumbling over with
life
Should see her work her books
I mean my poor Neil tried to commit suicide in nineteen eighty nine
Mm
Took seventy aspirin
It was fu ah
It was funny she did er m
What looks better a or
The tin foil
b
Yes
The simple one mm
The tin foil
That one
looks nice
Mm
When's this gotta be in by
Monday
Is everybody gonna do it or is it your choice if you do it
You can either draw it model it made me draw the last one I'll model it this time it's good fun
Mm
If you use the
So this one looks better
You said you had to model it but make it squeeze it in the middle so it's fatter at the ends that's it so it looks like a canoe
Bren
paddle yeah
What's that back of your car
Oh I've opened the boot I gotta bring you wanna bring all the shopping in Dave ha ha
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Y you ca you can talk to Jean there's that paper
Bring it in
Mm mm mm mm
What ha what about if all the pen what if I put some extra tin foil just a bit at the end
Oh I don't know really I haven't thought
I got a bit left over from when I cut it I'll just bring it in this bit there
I've sort of squeezed the tin foil so that it it fits very very tightly around the middle
Oh ah
And then it bulge s at the end you see that'll do cos if you
What about if I do an extra bit at the end
Well I don't think it'll be a good idea at all because my no my knowledge of tin foil leads me to believe that tin foil wrapped on tin foil falls off
Oh
I think you'll be better off with it like that
Where's my
Not yours
Can I have my my t wee
Oh lovely

Free
they give you and that's and that's
Oh that's free
and that comes free that's right that comes free so two people go out and they share the cost of the meal
Oh that's a good idea isn't it
I couldn't eat the damn meal I had er m steak and kidney pudding s no steak and kidney pastry pie
Was it a pub meal
Yes well a a very nice pub
Yeah but they do some those pub meals they reckon now are best value for money and the most
They are
filling
They are er m it was er steak and kidney pie brussels sprout s carrots and bo plain boiled potatoes I could only eat about half the kidney and meat I cou I could only eat about a third of the pastry couldn't cope with the carrots at all or the brussel sprout s they were beautiful brussel sprout s like little cabbages you know I could only eat a couple of them
Okay can
Right you go and get your jimmy - j a m s on I'll be up
I had sherry trifle of des as a desert and I ga gave Peggy half of it
God
It's not like me I mean I normally yum yum yum
Well that meal tonight wasn't exceptionally big that curry
It wasn't it was a standard portion
normally we'd eat that and a great big gate aux
That's right
But I mean no I think I think it's obviously sort of sort of reduced
Oh yes yes
and you I used to eat so slow they'd all all sort of finish and I was still sort of tuck
Mm
I said I don't know what i
Mm
whether I dunno what it is whether it is your your tummy reduced or
I don't know er m one of the most interesting in some ways
one of the nicest things that happened to me since I've been widow ed is having Neil to look after not only is he an exception

That plumber didn't charge Dave anything
Oh that's nice isn't it

Oh that is nice
I like that very much

And er m Revlon is a very very good medium priced range
Ooh we've we've brought home half of Marks and Spencer s with us

To be honest

Going to get this amount
No
No way
Because you wouldn't you'd think oh no no they wouldn't want that we wouldn't want that
And same as me

Tomorrow cos dad's er m Nigel's gonna be phoning dad in the afternoon
So Jill's gonna phone you tomorrow but you're not going out tomorrow morning are you

Jill's phoning you tomorrow morning
So it might be easier she said that she's going to visit Vic at two o'clock
Mm
till about half three
Then she's coming home and then she's going back over there about six o'clock till eight o'clock
And she was gonna said that she was gonna drop you off there at two then pick you up again at eight
Now you're not gonna wanna be six hours at a hospital bedside are you

So what I thought to do if Jill phones tomorrow morning
Mm
cos dad's gonna be working now till about three anyway so he's not gonna be able to take you
Say to Jill yes you could go over with her at two o'clock and then come back with her about four
And just you're just gonna nip in with dad then and try and get your suit
Mm
Yeah
Yeah
I looked at that one again at Bur tons today
Er m and the is is James' sort of like the light i sh grey was it eighty nine ninety nine sort of a slate sort of grey
Dunno
Might be
It's not it's not a light grey with lines in it
Sort of looks almost sort of shiny i sh
I don't know
I can't remember
You can't remember
Well they've got that
No
and they've also got it in a dark green which is really nice
In a dark green
Yeah
Sort of er m
Bur tons in Wo king
Yeah
It's sort of like an olive y green
Not bottle green
It's sort of like er m what's an olive green in here Jean
Well I was just looking round is it like the colour of that
Yes
Very sort of lighter than no lighter than that
That's bottle
It's a lot lighter than that
Yes
Something like in that picture
Mm
It's like that
Yeah
Mm
Mm
Have you seen it
Yeah well that's eighty nine plus there's fifteen percent off
What are the ones that the Italians wear called
Special ones
What do you call the double - b r e a s t e d Italian suits
Don't remember
But what I'll do is if tomorrow I get time I'll have a look in er m Top Shop
If I'm over that way
And if there is any decent suits then I'll let you know
M hm
And then if you don't get it tomorrow perhaps one night after school
It might be easier just to hire one
No
Why pay fifty quid to hire one
It's ridiculous
When you're gonna pay seventy five quid and you've got one
Mm
Mm
Yeah but where am I gonna wear it again
I'll would outgrown it within a few months
Well no you buy a size bigger
Oh definitely yes
You like them bigger
I mean you buy it you're not gonna I mean alright you're gonna have a bit more grown but you're only gonna get a bit more m usc ly
And you like them baggy anyway you don't get one that fits you er buy That's why I said it would have been probably better to pay the extra twenty quid and bought the Italian style double - breasted
Mm
for their baggy effect see
Yeah but where can you buy them
Tut that shop next door to er m Inter sports
Suit and Co I think that's called
No
That it's a nice man's shop
It's a beautiful man's shop
Yeah I know
It's dear
Yeah but I don't see savings they've got on suits at the moment special offers on them cos they're not shifting them
But it's ridiculous you fifty quid a night to hire a suit
Because you pay your fifty pound and that's it
But this suit I mean
That's what I said if you buy a grey suit the trousers you'll I mean alright if you don't I mean you'll wear grey won't date
Will it Jean
No
No
It never dates
Green will date
Yes
And you'll get bored with it
Mm
Yeah
But grey will not I mean Granddad Sid's
Goes on forever
sixty five and he's still wearing his grey suits
Yes
Yes
I mean dad got married in his suit
I mean now he's given it to granddad
But grey the actual
It doesn't fit him
Yeah it doesn't fit him
I mean it hasn't I mean dad's was quite an expensive suit when he got married
I mean alright that's eighteen years ago
And the t ro us I mean the jacket never I mean very rarely does a suit jacket style change
The trousers you get flare d but that's no problem cos you just have them altered
If you have them you know I mean I can't see I mean you wear your trousers baggy i sh and long
It's not it's not time for flare d trousers yet
No
That's what
I'm saying
It's not time
And I haven't got no shoes to go with whatever I get
Well you'll get a pair of shoes
Well you got to have shoes we know you've got I mean you've got need new school shoes
You've gotta have this new pair of shoes as well
No good worrying about it Lee you've got I mean you can't you've gotta have the things you've gotta have
Mm
But you'll have to get your moon boots and things like that
You'll have to buy them for your skiing trip
Mm
sort of been given a hundred pound upstairs
Because that's what they money they'd owed you
Does he
And it well you're meant to get fifteen pound aren't you he's meant to pay you for the work
Yeah
But you haven't got fifteen pound
You're a bit skint
Well I'm going to chip in with thirty aren't I
Jean's gonna help towards your trip too
Okay
Thanks Jean
And n an 's gonna help so
Oh yes
You'll cope with it but you've gotta buy your moon boots we should be able to get the market Jill said around I mean we can get them in cash and carry for nine ninety nine but we should be able to get them at Black bus he market for five to six ninety nine
Yeah
We've managed to hire the jackets the Sal o pet tes the ski glasses the socks I've sorted out I've told n an to buy you for Christmas
That's no problem
The an or a k we've hi we've borrowed
So we've borrowed everything er m oh you've gotta buy some proper ski gloves
You want those cos they're thirty seven quid aren't they and they're in the sale for seventeen quid at the moment
Half price
Yeah I saw that but it's not they're going quite quickly
Because
Yes I'd I'd pounce on those because
has got
We might have a look in Inter sport cos Wo king Yeah
But I looked today in er m cash and carry sport and they were the same price
No they were nineteen quid
But they were the short ones
The ones you want are the good long ones aren't they
And thermal
Your hands are really warm
I know and they're thirty odd quid
The right price
Mm
And what are they down to
Seventeen ninety nine
Throw your body across them
Yeah
We'll see if we can pick up a pair of them
Mm
Perhaps you can have them for Christmas or something
Er m so we've managed to hire everything so all you've gotta you've gotta buy is your moon boots
M hm
Er m the suit you've got to have
You've got to have
I've got to have that by December the thirteenth
Yeah well if we don't get it tomorrow we'll have to go one night it's late night shopping till nine o'clock
Mm
If dad's on his half past four if he can get to kip if you go over at seven o'clock one night
It's not gonna take you it's only gonna take you and dad an hour isn't it
Mm
But he's got to do it on Access because there's no money in the bank to write a cheque out and pay for the suit
So I can't go and do it
Have I got any cash cards
No and you're not having cash cards either
Why
What do you want a cash card for
No it's
You can't draw out cash if it isn't there
And and that's the trouble with the cash card
You you tend to think
You can't have a cash card with a post office account anyway
No
No with the Alliance though
Yeah but what do you wanna cash card for
So I can get money out if I ever need it
Yeah but that money is you've saved and I mean n an put that in when you were younger too a lot of it
So I mean it's for when you're older
When you're desperate you need it not to just draw out and spend
I know
I won't just draw out and spend
No you don't
You will you know
I'm the expert on that
Mm
I've drawn out and spent
Because it was there
I I mean it's ever so difficult to resist the temptation
Mm
to spend money
It it it's like me
If I had an Access card I would buy him this that and everything
And I'd say oh come on we'll buy the suit
Mm
And then right and then you can also buy the shirt and tie
Mm
You can afford that
Cos you've got all that money saved
We've had to sponge off him all week
Borrow all his money
And it ended up we owed him say ninety quid
I know
I know
Mind you he went out and he had to have er er m mind you he's had that when you think of it you've had half of that back
I said to Dave I said how have you spent all that money
He said I've been giving Lee dinner money every day
I said well I wondered he didn't ask me for it
I said I thought he was using his own
No all he's given me each day is paper money plus about one fifty
So all together given me about five pounds
Yeah well it adds up
Yeah I know
And we had to pay fifteen quid for the train ticket
So that's another twenty quid
We've gotta pay for your computer
It adds up dreadfully
I mean I'm subbing one well I'm subbing two of my lodge r s
I'm subbing Neil but that's out of money which he gives me and which really in theory ought to be for my own own use you know for fun but I get housing benefit for him from the council
And most of that goes back to him for his karate and a pint of beer in the pub
And I I sort of do le out a little here and a little there
And I'm also subbing my lodge r Paul
Er m and it it it mounts up
By the time you've bought them some cigarettes and given them some money for the pub and said well if there er and the car hasn't got any petrol so you pay for ten pounds worth of petrol
You're through fifty pounds before you can blink an eye lid
Mm
It's one of the well known things about money
How much would you say this lot here was Lee
Including these and that here
Yeah
They're all Neil's presents
Er m Was there a sale on
No
No
Sixty
Two hundred and fifty nine
Two hundred and fifty nine
Yeah
That was it wasn't it Brenda
No more because I then paid another thirty approximately for that two hundred and eighty nine for that that that came to twenty seven and I had there were two items inside it I forget what they are
There's another nearly thirty pound cheque on top of the Marks and Spencer charge card
